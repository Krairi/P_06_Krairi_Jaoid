"*yawn*  This is the forgettable sort of bar that you wish you hadn't wasted the neurons trying to forget.

The couple times I've been here it was awkwardly empty, and the people who were there were just off.

Awkward bar clientele roll call:
* Old creeper staring from across the bar. (PS: axe murderer or misplaced lust?)
* One excessively drunk single woo girl.
* Excessively drunk single woo girl's 3 ex-frat boy ""friends"" who keep buying her drinks.
* Man eating alone in the booth behind you.
* Guy watching TV alone. Shouts frequently at it.

I'm not a particular fan, so I wouldn't recommend it. There are better suburb bars in the area. For what it's worth, the connected restaurant, Chi Thai, is very good.",2
"Ordered all veggies, because of my clean eating regimen and as I returned to work from my 1hr lunch I discovered that ALL my veggies were literally swimming in OIL & GREASE!!! I was more than pissed, but knew it would be a lost effort to attempt to take anything back. I did in turn call the business and make a complaint. Wont return. #LostCustomer",1
"I used to love this place. I ordered the honey chicken, so chewy it was not edible. Rice was dry and crunchy. It was so bad, I threw it in the trash. Complete waste of money.",2
"When I was at Babson, there was a big controversy about the staff being racist(similar to Diva incident) and harassing my friend and her dinner party(bc they were Asians), and she did something about it- spoke out.

I used to eat here, but never again because I believed her unlike my piece of shit Alma mater who tried to make HER apologize.
Tangent.

Don't support racists.",1
"We ended up at the location in Cambridge, MA just by chance.  It's in a food court like area, hope this is the right location.  

Husband got a lobster roll and a cup of New England chowder.  It's generic lobster probably from Costco, but fine.  Chowder was decent.

Think he told me it was $11 for the roll & chowder.",2
"Back in 2002 I remember having a macaroni pie from this counter in the Garage food court . It was quite good. Since then, they redesigned their menu (and counter). I just recently tried the new Boston Chowda Co., twice, and was quite disappointed.

First, I tried the haddock pie. I'd had a salmon pie elsewhere, which was great, so I had high hopes for this. Until I tasted it. It consists of little haddock pieces in gravy, with cracker crumbs on top. No crust, as there should be. Neither the haddock nor the gravy nor the crumbs were very flavorful. The only upside is that you get a fair amount of food for your $5. But I wouldn't get it again.

Then, I tried a tuna roll. Their rolls (and wraps) on display under glass--shellacked, presumably--look wonderful, absolutely stuffed with meat. But the one they actually served me had much less tuna, some lettuce, and just a few pieces of tomato. Another disappointment.

So I won't be eating at the Chowda Co. again. Not when Harvard Square has much better lunch options (including Felipe's Taqueria right across the room).",2
"completely less-than mediocre. i had a tomato-mozzarella wrap, in which there was far too much chopped lettuce and a complete absence of the pesto mayo sauce - the only hope it had for any flavor. bf's kielbasa from the attached hot dog-sausage-oriented Doghouse was was okay, nothing spectacular. and the ""fresh"" lemonade is from one of those continually-spouting machines and is most certainly not ""fresh.""",1
"This is the first time we ate at Finians under the new management.  It was not a good experience! Let's see, where do I start.  As we walked in, we felt the unwelcome atmosphere.  The waitress started off pretty nice, giving us our beverages.  When she took our orders, she told my boyfriend that the prime rib was sold out for the night, then he decided to order something else and was ALSO told it was sold out.  OK, then she suggested a stuffed pork-- ""it's really good"" she said.  Little did we know, it was gross-- it was dry and hard.  Also, after our third round of ""free refills"" on soda, the waitress took our cups away and never came back! Not to mention, all the food was very salty and we were still eating!! Never again will we go back...",1
"I can't say that I got a warm fuzzy feeling eating at this place. I was driving around Quincy with my friend searching for lunch options today when we passed the Finian's. There was a clearly visible sign boasting great specials for traditional American fare. Time being an issue we quickly decided to eat here and try our luck.

Upon entering the place wasn't that busy. The majority of the crowd appeared to be in their 70's and it was mostly quiet aside from the TVs displayed over the bar. No one was their to great us and I took the initiative to go over to a waitress and ask if we should seat ourselves. With a scowl she informed us that we would be seated in just a moment. When I returned someone was at the host stand and took us to a table, dropped off some menus and the specials list without much to say and left us to our own devices.  The food selection was vast, the prices reasonable and I was content with the choice so far.

As we made our decisions a few things became more noticeable. One was the scent of ""old people"" that permeated the air around us. The second was the lack of smell of food. Another was the shockingly contrasting styles of furniture and colors that reminded me of the movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Colors clashed with colors, patterns clashed with patterns. None of it inspired me to feel at home and like I wanted to have a good meal. 

The waitress was ok. She handled the formalities of ordering well, but that was the extent of it. Warmth was not her strength nor was attentiveness as we finished our drinks and eagerly awaited mor eto satiate our needs.  

We ate, waited a while to pay our bill, and left without having very much human contact aside from our own. Being that I wasn't greeted nor asked to return again (I didn't even expect that someone would take the time to see how our food was after being there for five minutes) I don't have a warm memory to carry with me. 

Overall the food was pretty average, and what you would expect from a place that reminds you of Denny's or Bickfords without the big chain feel. This isn't fine cuisine although something about that Chicken Parm didn't sit well with my friend. Maybe you'll have better luck.",2
"I've never done the bruch, and it seems like that's the thing to do if you go here. 

Place smells gross, is gross. Food was disgusting and heavy- when I left, i felt like I ate a bowling ball. 2 stars for the super nice waitress.",2
"Dirty booths, gross food, bad service.
trashy!",1
"Seems to me there has been a huge decline in qualtity and service.  Finian's used to be a great place for comfort food and served one of the best Roast Turkey Dinners around.  Last month, I went back for the first time in a while and was shocked to be served lunchmeat over sour tasting stuffing.

And the service was painfully slow -- I was there nearly two hours.  And, the place was virtually empty.

Wouldn't go back again.",1
"Just got back from their Sunday brunch.  Years ago I remember there were tons of people waiting to be seated;  but then, years ago it was worth the wait.  Today's fare was terrible to see and terrible to taste.  We'll not be returning.",1
"Oh please!

This is THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!! Not only was the waitress totally obnoxious, she brought the beverages for the two men in the party and all but ignored the female! Even after being corrected, she still had to asked again and when she finally arrived with the cocktail (shortly before dinner arrived!) she was blatantly RUDE! You'd think I was putting her out! Little did she know! 

much It was to my delight, that she tried to hand off the tab to the gentlemen, however, I INSISTED on paying (minus the tip...yes it was THAT BAD!)

Sorry to say this was not our first encounter with elderly bleach blond but most certainly the last! We complained to the owner on more than one occasion to no avail. As if that weren't enough all she could talk about was her daughter's restaurant! Go to work there and we'll come back!

Food is only average pub like dishes but it does have a nice bar and atmosphere. Personally, I don't feel like dodging bullets while trying to be served. The nasty looks and under the breath comments were way beyond.....even for someone with such an obvious lack of intelligence.and class.

Go to Alfredo's on Franklin Street right around the corner! Good food, good service, good prices! Monday and Tuesday (dining room only) they issue a gift card for a future purchase equal half of your food order...can't beat that. And the staff smiles!",1
"My husband and I wandered into Finian's one Sunday morning, looking forward to their brunch buffet. We walked in, and all you could smell was fish. So, we walked right out. Who wants to smell fish when you're eating waffles and bacon? There are actual seafood restaurants in Quincy [Tony's] that don't smell like fish. 

Maybe this is an unfair review because I didn't actually eat anything at Finian's... ambiance counts for something!",1
"Blah
The only reason I keep coming here is because I work in this building. I've been to good Au Bon Pains. I've been to great Au Bon Pains.. but this one is really just a pain.
This is supposed to be a quick Deli type of place. Orders take forever. When they screw up your order, they get upset at you. They forgot the blue cheese in my Cob Salad Wrap once, and they seemed upset I pointed this out to them. 
The bread for the wrap is usually dry and splits open half way through. There are so many great places in Boston, skip this one if you can. (and go to Falafel King... I really can't work that place into enough reviews).",2
"The setting is perfectly adequate, and the food comes close.   The dining chains like Chilis and Victoria Station do barbecue better.

It's no surprise you can always pick up coupons for Linwood at restaurant.com.",2
"AFter reading several good reviews, I went here and was very disapointed. They advertise it as a BBQ place, but there was not a large BBQ menu. The food was decent, but certainly not noteworthy. Maybe since I come from the South I have a higher standard of BBQ.",2
"Friendly service and great food, however the atmosphere was a little slow.",2
"Decent service, nice enough atmosphere, but TERRIBLE food.  My fiancees pulled chicken sandwich was barely edible.  The pulled pork sandwich was a little better.  Baked beans were awful.  I love BBQ in general and I wouldn't characterize myself as picky but this was one of the worst meals I've had since I moved to Boston several years ago.  Too bad because the place is close to my apartment and has an interesting beer list.  But if your'e planning to eat, AVOID.",1
"Used to love this place, it makes me sad to review these poor reviews - when the old Heretix boys started this, it was phenomenal & it slipped a great deal when changing management.

*************************07/29/07 UPDATE*********************
Linwood is no more, we found it closed & had to go to sorrento's to get a marginal meal for $100.  It's going to be a new shi shi place called ""Church"" apparently.  Someone please help me find something as good as these guys once were!",1
"I would put zero stars if possible. I went there years ago to watch the RSox game. The place was busy but the bartender was not doing anything since everyone but me had drinks. I was waving money at the bartender and he was looking directly at me but didn't move a muscle - just gave me an aggressive look. My friend (she is caucasian) came over to ask what the hold up was. I said to her that this guys won't serve me or I have no idea what is going on. So gave her the money. The bartender walked right to her and told her that he'd be happy to serve her but not me. She told him that I was dead sober. He said that didn't matter - he just didn't like ""my kind"".

I understand that Boston has a racist label because of the bus riots and general larger concentration of Caucasian people. However, I was born in Boston and have had very few experiences like that. Most people that I have met in the area are enlightened and appreciate diversity. I have also sat at a bar where someone next to me started talking to me about South Asian literature etc. Tell me your experiences or views on this matter.",1
"Just a note: A hot pepper ClipArt next to an entree generally denotes that a dish is going to be spicy.  So, when bf and I ordered one ""Hot"" item and one non-hot item, we weren't expecting Bland and Blander.  We were both hungry, so the Bland plate got eaten, as it was the lesser of two evils.

This place was vacant, so it was a nice quiet spot, but now I know why: bad food.  Also, they don't have free refills on Cokes. :(

Shoulda gone to the Thai place next door.",1
"They are CLOSED. Probably because they (allegedly) served minors and the exterior looks like  a dump. 

Signs indicate that it is to become ""Symphony 8"" - Fine Food and Fine Drinks

I'll update when the re-open",1
Food was good then my friend saw a flying roach on the table and asked the waitress to get rid of it. one roach means there are many more unseen. On the other hand they dont card underage drinkers. Its a good thing I'm over 21 and dont have to resort to tiger lilys for drinks.,1
"I only ever come here for the drinks. The food is a total waste of money. It's not just overpriced, it's just throwing your money down the drain cuz sometimes, the food is just so bad that it's practically inedible. I'm always around for the scorpion bowls though, which like everyone says, is great, but besides that, there's really no other reason to come here.",2
"I went here just the other night before seeing a play. I was overall very displeased with the service and the food. My friend and I sat down and ordered our food and I ordered a mango chicken dish and she ordered a noodle dish. 

After our order was placed, the waiter disappeared. We waited about 15 minutes and then the waiter came back and informed us that the kitchen was out of ketchup so they couldn't make my mango dish. First of all, KETCHUP? In Asian food? That disgusted me & I was thankful to change my order. 

The only time we saw our waiter again was when he delivered our mediocre, overpriced food. No refills on our water or sodas. 

I was shocked by the lack of service and inauthentic ingredients. I would not recommend Tiger Lily and I will not go back.",1
"Call me a sourpuss but I just don't get why people like this place. The inside is tacky, noisy with the college flock, and utterly charmless. The food is mediocre, simplistic, and inconsistently prepared. If this is the only time you're going to have Malaysian food, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. Service is spotty but spunky and courteous. The Scorpion bowls are saccharin sweet and weak.

There are so many better places that offer much better food and are good with groups - but none of them are open as late. I suppose that's how they manage to stay in business.",2
"Food is blah.  
Scorpion bowl is blah. 
Service is blah. 
They dont refill your drink. Yep. Thats just cheap.  
Drunken college students everywhere.  Unless its a Symphony night, then its overdressed white ladies from the suburbs holding on to their purses for dear life, while pretending to eat authentic ethnic food. 
Waiters always smell like sigs.  I hate that. 
Avoid this place.",1
"I don't get the fascination of this place.  Even if you go just for a scorpion bowl, I've still had better at the Cactus Club, or even Fire and Ice.  Try it if you wish, don't go back again if you don't like it.  Service is terribly slow.",2
"Tiger Lily is VERY mediocre. The only fun thing about this place is the previously mentioned scorpion bowl. Even those are only fun because they're a big bucket of alcohol. We got ""Orange"" and it was basically orange and mango juice with Everclear grain alcohol in it. Thats why previous reviewers got ""blackout drunk"" (which i guess is fun for them??). The food does not do much for soaking up those booze. The fried rice was terrible and the chicken tasted like MSG. The waitress was also super awkward and made the experience altogether no fun. I would say a definite no.",1
"Oh, Tiger Lily. Sadly, I have to give 2 stars, because the quality of the food here has plummetted in the past couple of years. Smaller portions, too. 

My friends and I used to go here after a long day for a delicious bowl of kari mee- dark, lovely broth with complex flavour and all the right porportions of ingredients, nice big clean shrimp, always fresh and always more food than we could eat. Now unfortunately it's another story. The last time I ordered kari mee it was just a small bowl, yellow turmeric type curry broth without much flavour, un-appetizing looking shrimps, kind of soggy. I still ate it because I was hungry and it wasn't inedible, but it was nowhere near as good as it used to be. The mee goreng seems to have suffered the same fate.

I wish they would cut it out and go back to what they used to be! There is no place in the area that is open so late, and Malaysian food on top of that. Too bad they're no good any more.",2
"I've been a fan of WaaZuBee for years, but an experience last weekend has me revising my loyalty. An old friend was in town for the weekend, and we decided to meet here for brunch.

We were seated right away, the place wasn't full (it was noon on a Saturday), and shortly thereafter placed our orders: huevos rancheros and guacamole for both of us.

45 minutes later, we were still waiting for our food. We asked our server (whose attention was unusually hard to attract) what was up. She went and asked the cooks, and eventually the manager came over. He apologized, one of the chefs had apparently gone home sick, and offered us each a free drink: we both ordered a glass of white wine. Ultimately, our meals took more than an hour to reach our table.

On the surface, the staff clearly did the right thing here. The thing is, it was too little too late. If a chef leaves and the food is gonna take a while, tell the affected customers preemptively. Offer them some bread. Don't wait for THEM to ask what's up, and then take another 10 minutes to offer them something to make up for it.

Then, just to further aggravate us, we were overcharged for our guacamole.

This has not turned me off WaaZuBee's for good: I'm still a fan of their  fries and garlic mayo, and wouldn't turn down an invite to eat here. But I'm pretty sure I won't suggest eating here again any time soon. There are too many good restaurants in this city, particularly on the Drive.",2
"Super unimpressed. Went back on Friday and had the Chicken Waazubwich which had been lovely in the past. Well, this time it was dry, the bread was totally not cut-able with a knife and fork, and there was hardly any sauce happening at all. 

The server rushed us, and wasn't particularly attentive. Bummer.",2
"Go for the atmosphere but not for the brunch!  It's better in the evenings and that is why i'm giving this 2 stars instead of just one.

Here's my story and I'm sticking to it!

On my plate: eggs over easy, brown toast, baked beans in tomatoe sauce(i don't understand this...who eats this for breakfast) and  hashbrowns.

The food review: One egg overdone, the other runny. Slightly greasy. sausage is not your typical pork sausage. However that being said, overdone as well. On the slightly spicy side but tolerable to the non-spicy folk. The beans were just silly. I would rather have fruit. The hashrowns were terribly greasy and overcooked.

Service: waitress had the personality of a tick.  It was almost next impossible to get our waitress to come to our table whether it was for service or to get the bill. We finally went up to the till and tried to pay where we still had to wait and felt as if we were inconveniencing her. OH, it was awful. 

It wouldn't have been such a  bad experience if it wasn't for the service. I think that blonde haired woman was having a bad day. I will say this, it was not the fabulous Marcie.

yeah. i've eaten here before and for the money, go elsewhere. you can do so much better on so many levels.",2
"really bad service for weekday lunch. Use to be a regular but since the manager and most of the staff left I'd give it a miss. Drinks are the strong point; good wines, gins, rums, and alot of beer options. Food portions are really small and over priced.",1
"I used to love Waazubee.  For the first year or so I lived here, it was great.  Over the past year, though, the food has gone from really good to poor.  Why did they get rid of the yummy garlic mayo that came with the fries?  What happened to that tasty dressing on the salad?  It is like eating grass now.  And they used to have real specials, like blue plate deals that had three courses for like $10 or $15 and they were good!  Now you can't get a decent salad here anymore. It seems like they are trying to change from a restaurant with edible food to a mere bar.  All of the old waitresses (with one exception) are gone.  And the paintings!  Please take those crappy muddy depressing ugly paintings down if you want anyone to have an appetite.  But, I guess they really don't want anyone to eat the food.  

It used to be my old reliable.  Now I avoid it like the plague.",1
"If this were based strictly on taste, Wing It might rate as high as four stars.  I mean, if one puts away the guilt of calorie-counting for a night, what's better than boneless wings dripping in sauce and slathered in blue cheese?  With 21 varieties -- the Rune's a fan of the Honey BBQ and the Teridactil [sic] -- Wing It does that pretty well.

That's the end of the appeal, I'm afraid.  Since replacing Avellino's some moon ago, Wing It has been the home of the world's least competent employees.  Trying not to be overly pejorative to the less fortunate, I still can't help but wonder if they don't hand out applications exclusively at half-way homes and special-education centers.

Here's a recurring (that's right, it's happened more than once) example:

A man (let's call him Derek) arrives with a $2 off coupon.  The cashier insists on disregarding said discount, initially, and ringing up the order at its full price and, seemingly, completing the transaction.  Thereafter (the change has been made and the register closed), cashier finally accepts the coupon, re-opens the register and hands Derek his two dollars.  Sometimes the end doesn't fully justify the means.

The delivery personnel is a creepy bunch.  I can't help but feel that they're casing my digs from the moment I open the door until our awkward dialogue finally ends and the door is shut.  I may start meeting them on the neighbor's lawn.  I won't even begin to rant about their proclivity for parking in the crosswalk outside the Wing It doors.

Unfortunately, they're Malden's best option for delivery wings.  Once the tormenting tribulations of acquiring them has ended, you're left with a decidedly delicious, waist-busting feast.",2
"I've ordered from Wing It numerous times because it's right down the street and I'm pretty sure I've never gotten exactly what I ordered. It's not hard to make an ok cheeseburger, but they sure mess it up. The wings are fine, but their burgers are always like little charcoal bricks that are still pink inside. It also takes at least 20 minutes to get the food and it's usually closer to 30-35. I do like the french fries though when they're not super crispy and the people are nice, even if they are incompetent.",2
"A wing place with no wings. Hmm.. who would have thought, but then again it IS Malden. (Malden is my hometown so I'm rightfully bashing it)

They had no wings! We were forced to order boneless which I personally hate. I guess it wasn't too bad since the filets were pretty juicy and well seasoned but STILL!! I agree with everyone else, EXPENSIVE. I can't believe that jerk forced me to pay extra for boneless when it wasn't exactly my fault they didn't have real wings.

Now that i'm on a rampage, their restaurant is quite DIRTY, sticky tables, and absolutely no decor or lighting. BOOOOO.",1
"Wing-It- we used to be very good friends. Weekday nights with your lg pizza, 10pc boneless xspicy jamaican or suicide buffalo wings, and 2 fries.
But then you changed.
You wouldn't deliver to Granada Highlands anymore
Your wings seemed WAY overly seasoned and dry.
but the straw that broke the camel's back was when you stopped making pizza! 
One of the holiest of holy trinities is pizza, wings and fries, and you had to go and Fu*k it all up.

Maybe I'll come back to you Wing-It, but you have to make some serious personal changes if we're ever going to have a relationship again.",2
"I was very much looking forward to a nice little, cozy pub/restaurant opening up in this spot. I finally went to get some dinner after a movie one night with a couple of friends. 

Ambience: The bar side is small, lively, pleasant. The restaurant side was kind of quiet, the music was muted so it felt a little too quiet, and there were only a few tables taken when we got there. The tables are laminate instead of wood which makes it feel a little like a cafeteria or a McDonald's instead of a pub. There's also a funny lounge in between the bar and restaurant sides. Kind of looks like a hotel lobby. 

The food was only mediocre. I got the fish n' chips and shared them with my boyfriend. The fries were thick and kind of soggy. The fish was fine, but lacking in flavor. The slaw, which I usually like, had all kinds of strange ingredients in it, like potato. It confused me so I stayed away, feeling unsure of what I was eating. My friend got a tuna melt which looked fine, nothing special. 

The beer selection is very good and the service was good. I would go back for a beer at the bar, and maybe a snack, but not for a sit down dinner in the restaurant.",2
Waited 20 minutes for an anemic hot dog and some garbage fruit. I won't make the mistake of coming here hungry ever again.,1
Seoul Food is closed. It has been replaced by Hunan Riverplace.,1
"When choosing the category for this restaurant, I wish there had been crap as a choice. 

My partner is on a see all the towns in Massachusetts kick, so we have been visiting all these little towns.
This weekend we went to Salem and stopped somewhere for a sandwich.

We ended up here because it was close and the two people I was with got some kind of chicken sandwiches and I had a vegetarian wrap.

My dining partners said their sandwiches were crappy, and the chicken was dry. When Kristin M. attempted to get some dressing to kick it up, the idiot counter girl gave her some vinegar and oil just poured on top of each other.

Now one of the things I HATE is unnecessarily cold food, so when I got my wrap that had almost no filling in it and the wrap was right out of the fridge, not room temp or grilled or anything, I already knew it was going to be bad.

It was a bland and poorly made wrap that didn't even have the sides tucked in.
The people behind the counter were incredibly unfriendly, but I actually think it might be because we were the only people of color they have ever seen in their lives, seriously.
She smiled and helped everyone but us.

The place itself was boring, a cheap couldn't decide if I am a diner or deli, or fast food joint kind of place.

So this place is a serious waste of time and stomach room.",1
"The joke around the Liberty Centre is the nickname for this place - Cafe No-Way. There are some valid reasons...granted, I have eaten here, and then paid for it. There is something seriously wrong with their lettuce...it gives everyone I work with including myself stomach cramps and frequent afternoon visits to the loo. The French fries are pretty tasty, but your thighs will eventually communicate that to the world. All the food is from a huge corporate frozen food distributor..nothing local, fresh, or organic...Which still shocks me being that we ARE in portland. Honestly, there are better options around...people just have to walk a block or two. But, really, your tummy, thighs, and other body parts will thank you.",2
"Well, this chain is owned by the ultra right-wing Kevin Cameron. Need I say more?",1
"This Bob Evans sucked. Would never come here again especially with family. Waited 1hr to get uncooked eggs, flat pancakes and horrible customer service.",1
"Stopped here for two reasons - it was across the street from our hotel and there were 8 of us so we were looking for an inexpensive meal.

Definition of the two star rating:
1. Location 
2. Price

The staff were nice enough - we had a large party (8 and a baby). They couldn't accommodate us all at one table but put us near each other which was okay.

I asked for a coke with lemon. Received a coke about 10 minutes later, no lemon. Ordered my meal - turkey bacon melt. Asked for a side of Mac and cheese and BBQ sauce for my fries. Received the meal after what seemed like eternity - no Mac and cheese OR BBQ sauce. What's the point of asking for things??

I wanted dessert but the waitress brought out our checks without even asking. Welp.

I understand this location was understaffed and it seemed as though many of the employees were frazzled. Working as a retail manager, I can understand but from what other reviewers have said, maybe management should intervene and make better business decisions.",2
"I hadnt been to a Bob Evans since I was a kid in Ohio in the mid 80's. So while on vacation in Florida I figured it would be fun to have breakfast here one morning for nostalgias sake.

whoa.

not the worst experience but very underwhelming. It started out promising as we were greeted at the door by a sweet older lady who seated us. We recieved our drinks in a timely manner. Than it took forever to place our order and then get our food. The place wasnt busy at all and I counted at least 5 servers, so i didnt understand the lag in service.

Than when our food did arrive it was very bland and lukewarm. 

Not trying to be harsh but Bob Evans seems to be a glorified Dennys. At least this one was..",2
"No, no, no!!!!
Cold breakfast, slow service and a table by the bathrooms. My first and LAST trip to Bob Evans! 
Hubby's grits were equivalent to soup, pancakes tasted disgusting and all was barley lukewarm!
Go to CRACKER BARREL!!!!!",1
"Typical. But my sister asked for a water and 10mins later she came back with it.
It was sort of busy at the time but all of our food was hot (myself and 5others) and it tasted good. I've had better. Nothing to go write home to mom about but it was alright.
Took a really long time tho to get your check payed for.
If your a Denny's fan and have never had this place- go to Denny's.",2
"We love Bob Evans, however, this was not a good experience.  Glasses were dirty, long wait with loads of empty tables, potatoes not fully cooked, hot cocoa ordered, but never received and then charged for, hash browns tasted like dirty grease.  Very disappointed.",2
"Well, need I say more, this is a chain.  Now coming from California, I wasn't aware this was a chain, but it was essentially a diner.  The salmon was a bit dry and tasteless.  With the humid weather and the thunderstorms outside, gloomy weather, the overall ambiance was not good at all.  The food did not help.",2
"This place does not even deserve a star! We were seated by the ""busboy"" cause everyone was too damn busy bitching  about who's going home. And after we were seated the busboy came by with our drinks (he's not our problem he did good) then 2 other families  came in after us and got served there salads and drinks and got there order taken. 2 waitresses  physical looked right at us and walked the other direction and still didn't serve us. Manager could care less if we were happy or not. We walked out after the other couple who walked in 15 mins  after got there order taken......WORST PLACE EVER DON'T GO!!!!!!!",1
"The first time I walked into this place, I was overwhelmed by a dirty, musty odor and left.  

My husband was insistent upon giving it another try so we went back for drinks on a Friday night around 8. Must have been too early for people watching as the place was entirely dead.  The waitress was actually very friendly and nice, though, and made some suggestions on cocktails. She gets 4 stars. Unfortunately, the cocktails were just not good. Very watered down and not tasty.  I gave them two tries (a margarita & a cosmo). Both seem like very straightforward, basic drinks but they failed on both accounts.

I will add the caveat that this is clearly not a martini bar so it was probably a stupid choice on my part.",2
"Dark, dingy, and wicked fricken packed. Weekend nights almost always end with busted faces in the streets outside. I guess it's a club dive? I'm not sure. I enter this place only when someone wants to do a proper Malden Bar Crawl. 

This was the first bar I saw the difference between HD and regular TV. I was inebriated, and the regular TV was very blurry. The HD TV was still crystal clear. It defied my drunk. For that, I guess Veez deserves a star. This place really isn't a destination station.",1
"this is part three of the four part series titled ""the worst tour"".  please see my review of bennigans for back story.
we visited the tgif's on town lake under the radisson.  so guess what, there were tourists everywhere.  the beer selection was subpar and we were surrounded by tourists.  that doesn't deserve two stars does it?  i said it previously, that good service can even make a dump bearable and our server brittany did just that.  she took care of our birthday boy in tow that was not having a good time since we had just been to bennigans and hooters (part one and two of ""the worst tour"").  she brought out shots at her discretion and was very prompt and friendly.  she gets the two stars, not the establishment.  typical chain bullshit.  stuff thrown up on the wall to give the impression or originality, radio quality music, etc.  
well, jake almost thought ""the worst tour"" was over as we headed into downtown, but he was mistaken.  time for the worst of the worst.  hello coyote ugly!!",2
"Well let me start off by saying I am ""P"" as mentioned in Laura T.'s review, so yes my experience SUCKED. 

My girlfriends and I went out for a friend's birthday and we were intrigued to go to TGI Friday's because they had BOGO Entree Free coupons. Yes, I brought my newborn who is nursing.. and the waitress nearly elbowed him in the head when setting down my food in front of me. I wont repeat what Laura T. said because she's already said it about C's burger, A's ""gourmet 5 cheese mac n cheese"" and her mojito... But I will tell you about my pork chop.

My pork chop was pink and undercooked. Anyone know what the risks of eating undercooked pork are? ""Trichinosis, also called trichinellosis, or trichiniasis, is a parasitic disease caused by eating raw or undercooked pork "" not to mention Tapeworms. Come on guys, simple sanitation and food safety rules! 

I am a stay at home mom, meaning I provide full-time care to my children (1 month  and 21 months) throughout the day. I cannot afford to be sick! Imagine having food poisoning when you are breastfeeding an infant every 2 hours, and taking care of a toddler with the terrible two's. I will spare you the TMI details and just describe it as HELL. 

Now there are other people in our party who ate completely different foods yet still ended up getting sick. My bess guestimation would be this is the result of CROSS CONTAMINATION. 

And come on, how hard is it to keep our drinks full when we are THE ONLY TABLE IN THE BACK. Seriously, the automatic 18% gratuity they tack on to a bill for a party of 8 or more is FAR too much. I wouldn't even tip the normal 10% for satisfactory service. When I sent my porkchop back, the waitress asked if I wanted another one. Yes, please give me another uncooked porkchop and the opportunity for some cook to spit in my food. Honestly, I should have had a manager check out my food so they are aware that their cooks aren't cooking the meats completely. 

Ugh, I feel sick just remembering it. Never will I go back to Friday;s and I will try to save everyone I can by spreading my terrible experience. And instead of comping my meal....I would just like for the health department to shut the damn restaurant down. It will happen sooner or later I'm sure.",1
"For my hundreth review i decided to review the only restaurant i put on my personal boycott list. TGIF. If i was a pimp and you was my hoe, i would of pimped slapped yo' ass back in 1999 and kept it up until today. This review is for all TGIF's. I might go off to some other specific TGIF's and give the rundown on why i hate that actuall TGIF, but i just have to say that TGIF did win one award from me, the worst service in the World. 
Here i give you the award button for crap. pin it on your flair vest or something. 

I have been to five TGIFs and they all sucked. The ones in Austin, the one in Seattle, the one in Dallas, and the one in Tacoma. U all suck. I would rather vote for Mccain and be his bitch boy before I ever step foot inside a TGIF again. 

I gave you one star because they wont let me give 1 / 756875687 of a star. 

(maybe not that extreme on the Mccain thing. Its not that serious. But you got my point right?)",1
"Summary: The food here was disappointing but their Brownie Obsession dessert is to die for! Try out Chili's for a better alternative.

(6/10) Sizzling Chicken & Shrimp
This dish is on the ""Best of Friday's"" section of the menu but it could have been better. It comes with one medium sized chicken breast, a handful of shrimp, onions, peppers, and mashed potatoes.  The chicken is tender and flavorful, however the shrimp is chewy. The mashed potatoes come without gravy, but goes well when dipped in melted cheese (what doesn't go well with melted cheese?!).

(5/10) Southwest Mac & Cheese
When we saw the picture in the menu, we knew we had to get this one, especially since we love macaroni and cheese. The delicious description made our mouth water - juicy fire grilled chicken with creamy white cheddar jalapeno sauce.  However, this this dish did not come as described and was a huge let down.  First of all, T.G.I. Friday's uses penne pasta instead of macaroni. Secondly, they left the chicken in the fire-grill way too long.  The entire piece of chicken was dry and half of it burnt to a crisp. There is no hint of jalapenos and the cheese is not ""cheesy"" at all.

(4/10) Fiery Chicken Popper Sandwich
This sandwich is neither fiery nor popping, and did not live up to its name. Its described as a crispy chicken breast, smothered with cream cheese & jalapeno habanero jelly and topped with jalapenos.  Naturally, one would expect a spicy sandwich but there is no jalapeno kick to it.  They skimped on the chicken and the ciabatta bread was dry and hard. Stay away from this one!

(8/10) Brownie Obsession
T.G.I Friday's finally got something right! If you are a chocolate lover, then your mouth is in for a treat.  The brownie is served warm and drenched with Ghirardelli chocolate-fudge sauce and topped with a delicious scoop of creamy ice cream.  We'll use three words to describe this dish: rich, chocolaty, fudgelicious.  It doesn't get any better than this!

(6/10) Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie
If you are a fan of peanut butter desserts, then this is for you. The pie has a graham cracker crust, a thin layer of chocolate, peanut butter mousse, and topped with whipped cream. It is rich and fluffy, but if you want more substance, get the brownie.

Service (5/10)
It was a slow night when we went so we were seated immediately. The service is mediocre. The waiter checked up on us once or twice, but never refilled our water. Also, since he rang up the bill incorrectly, we were overcharged.

Ambiance (6/10)
T.G.I. Friday's amibiance is similar to that of Chili's - very casual.  The restaurant is large and has plenty of seating in the dining and bar areas.  Parking is sufficient because it is located in a shopping area. If you are looking for a restaurant with a huge variety of food that is good for families or friends, we recommend Chili's or Bennigans.",2
"This is the first time I have ever written one of these ""review"" things.

THIS PLACE SUCKS

1. overpriced (7$ for chicken and rice)
2. the chicken was terrible: chewy  and covered in a sweet boring brown sauce
3. weird vibe:  like they didn't want me in there.   

awful awful  AWFUL",1
"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

Huh? Wha? Oh...

Sorry about that. I must have dozed off. My boring bento lunch from Get Bento just put me to sleep. It wasn't terribly bad- just uninteresting. The grilled veggies were ok I guess. (Yaaaaawwwn)

What was I dreaming about just now? Well, funny you ask. I was dreaming of all the ways I could have spent the seven dollars that I just wasted. Now if you'll (yawn) excuse me. I am veryzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.",2
"YOU SUCK!!!!!!!!

(no not you, dear sweet Yelper. Did i mention how lovely you look today?)

I hate Get Bento. It is one of those places that I TRY to like over and over again and i am DISAPPOINTED over and over again.

it's pretty expensive for Bento.
it's covered in some mystery sauce (teriaki?) that tastes like anus.
i'm not sure the beef is really beef. i HAVE seen a lot of dogs hanging out outside that place though. ;)
i ALWAYS get a stomach ache after.

to sum up...NO. 
DON'T Get Bento.
Get Something Else.
Anything Else.",2
"man, I'd hoped for better.  It wasn't bad.  It just wasn't...much.  The sauce was sticky, the chicken was boring, the veggies were unexciting.  The rice (brown) was fine.  It was expensive.  $7 (plus tip) for a tiny-ass bento boat?  Ouch.  I know I'm sitting in the pearl district, but I need some grub!  

When I think of bento, I think inexpensive and I think decent portions.  You'd better have at least one of the two.  If you're curious what I'm referring to, checkout Du's Grill (Sandy)...I'd say the gold standard.

The soy sauce was empty too, but there wasn't enough food to bother asking for more.",2
"Disappointing and bland. 

In what appears to be an old service station building, the interior shows signs of a haphazard conversion into a restaurant, which adds a little character but mainly just looks unprofessional.

Had never heard of the ""temp-eh"" (apparently some sort of miso-esque tofu concoction from a local place in Hood River?) and wanted to try it, but they had run out, failed to receive a fresh shipment, et cetera. Genial counter-dude suggested the veggies, which came in two skewers, liberally squirted with sweet red chili sauce (Trader Joe's? pretty much) over rice.

The vegetables, though scoring points for being nominally organic, didn't especially taste very good, as if they lacked seasoning. The presentation reminded me of West Coast Bento but certainly not the taste or price -- damn expensive!

Dropped in on a whim and with an appreciation for the clever logo, won't be going back.",1
"Maybe Bento just isn't my thing, however, I was not thoroughly impressed...ordered a chicken bento, lots of rice, not so much chicken.  

Pros-
It's a block from my work.  You can catch a city WIFI signal for either your laptop or PDA.  A cute girl works there in the afternoon.  Outside seating too.  The meats I think were all organic.  New establishment to the Pearl.

Cons-

Who wants to pay $8.00 for a stupid bento???  Limited menu...wait, isn't bento supposed to be simple...?",1
"This could be so cool, but it's not!

When i first saw this place,  I was like "" Oh Suh-weeeeet Bento near my work! The Bento gods have shown their light upon me!"" WRONG!

This place has the potential to be good and cool, but it's not.
It's overpriced and bland.

I really dislike questionable chicken, and this place had me asking questions 'o' plenty.  And a few shriveled veggies on a skewer...really?
Nope, not gonna cut it for this gal. Bento is pretty simple, but this place has managed to mess it up.
Oh...and it kinda smells like cat pee...the end.",1
"I've tried the bento when they first opened, and didn't like it all. Not only is it way over priced for bento, but the chicken was dry, and the entire thing just tasted weird. I tried it again, with the same results. Bland, overpriced and the people that work there act like they're doing you a favor. Never again, and I discourage co-workers when they mention trying it. Cup a noodles is better...",1
"I was excited that a bento shop opened in the Pearl, but after trying this place, I'll keep looking. 

Parking completely sucked, the prices were steep and the food just plain sucked. No sauce choices, everything drowned in teriyaki. The tiny chicken pieces were hack dry and bland. Really disappointed. The two GLOWING reviews were obviously planted to boost the rating. I'll keep going to Rice Junkies downtown.",1
"One of the worst bar foods I've tasted. They drench their food in oil, grease, butter, salt, and whatever else they can get their hands on. My wife and I had 2 different dishes, and both came out oily, greasy, buttery, and salty. Usually, those ingredients can make a food taste good according to Paula Deen. But we had a hard time finishing our foods. The service was good though.",2
"This place seems to be having problems lately. I was there on Mother's Day around 2pm, and it took over an hour from the time we put our name on the waiting list to the time we got food. The restaurant was only half-full, however, so obviously it was seriously understaffed. The manager was very apologetic, and agreed to delete two dishes from our check, as well as provide a free dessert. 

We came in again a couple weeks ago (since we had a Restaurant.com certificate to use) and had a similarly unpleasant experience. Orders came out wrong and the kitchen was ""out of hamburgers"" and other necessary ingredients. The service was friendly and sympathetic, however, and once again the manager made concessions. 

Crescent Moon's food is good, but I don't see this location staying around much longer. They simply do not have their act together, and obviously cannot make money at this rate.",2
"You know, i've never written one of these, but the most oddly unpleasant dining experience recently unfolded in front of me, and I thought I may need to spread the word.
Here's how it went down:
I was already not exactly thrilled to be in a mall, particularly this mall, but we were hungry and had been here before and had fine enough meals  in the past,  so we went ahead.  My wife ordered a southern dinner plate and I went for some sort of southwestern salad.  A dubious choice, I'll admit, but there you have it.  We both ordered iced tea.  
The littany of transgresssions is as follows:  
1. The tea tasted like coffee.  Now, I love coffee and I love tea, but I just don't want them unceremoniously mixed in the kitchen.  They later explained that there were coffee grounds in the same device in which the tea is brewed.  Apparently that was no big deal.
2. Due evidently to some kitchen snafu, I was given two different little plastic tubs of dressing.  These two flavors not only clashed, they created a ruckus that could probably have been heard down the hall at the Sears.  One, apparently, was the ""correct"" dressing.  The other, was not.  Why, oh why did I dump them both??
3. My wife's smashed potatoes were indeed smashed,  but they were clearly smashed hours before we arrived and had a visible layer of lacquered crust on top.  She tried, but just couldn't eat them.
4. That tickly feeling on my ankle about 2/3 of the way through?  Yup.  A cockroach.  I'm not kidding.
These events had my head spinning to be sure, and as I waited for a bill to arrive - a bill I intended to pay just as I had paid every other bill I've encountered - I realized that something needed to be said.  So I gulped and asked, ""Is there a manager around?""
After relating the harrowing story, the manager pleasantly lopped a few items off the bill, namely the coffee-tea and the salad, and offered me a dessert.  I accepted.
Normally, that would have been fine.  I wouldn't have complained and would have chalked it up to just a ""bad day.""  But when I got the strawberry shortcake home and took a big bite, it tasted as though it had been spritzed with a strange mixture of cheap toothpaste and Lysol, and left to sit uncovered for a week.  It was truly, truly awful.
Maybe it was their Let's-stick-it-to-the-guy-who-complains dish.
I'll never know.  Sorry Crescent Moon.  You're off my list.",1
Used to live right near here. I tried breakfast twice. Two times too many. Worst potatoes. Surprisingly busy. Take a step or three and hit up another spot (really! anywhere!). Recommended for coffee and wi-fi purposes only. If Starbucks down the street hadn't been fire bombed by the lunatics this horrible breakfast wouldn't exist.,2
"We went here for trivia and man... do I miss Loco's! The kitchen was really backed up so it made service REALLY slow.  I ordered a grilled cheese, not good. My boyfriend got a philly cheese steak, he said it was alright. Most everyone else's food was decent, but not anything particularly good. Now I'm wanting a Looney Bird...",2
"This place is poor from start to finish. Service was less than average, at best (We saw our server 4 times at most our entire time). This place also has the worlds slowest 'bartender' (Just wanted to light her hair on fire to see if she could move at more than a snails pace). 

I overheard people talking about how earlier that night the owner had yelled and cursed out patrons in front of the entire bar/ grill. I can't really consider that in my review since I didn't witness it myself (But I still found it believable and worth mentioning) 

Food is nothing amazing and definitely not worth the price. I could continue to rant about how much this place sucks but I think it's obvious from it constantly being empty and the other reviews here. 

Don't waste your money or time. Fado's is blocks away and miles better.",1
"A couple of friends and I went there to watch a football game.  We all ordered Terrapins and Sweetwaters.  On the menu it says domestics 3.50 and imports 5.00.  We were charged 5.00 for each beer, no big deal but we asked for an explanation being that both of these beers are brewed in state, Sweetwater less than 3 miles away.  

The manager absolutely went off on us, embarrassed his wait staff and then we come to find out this guy is the owner!  His name is Jack, he's the old guy with white hair you'll see there.  He blew us off, telling us that he's served over 80,000 beers and that he gave us our discount and stormed off, refusing to speak with us.  We simply were trying to inform him his menu was inaccurate and he crapped his pants.  I can't believe the OWNER of a young establishment has the audacity to blow off new patrons.  

I will be actively marketing negatively about this place from now on.",1
"This large restaurant lacks privacy and intimacy.  It reminded me more of the Olive Garden than a romantic North End restaurant.  The food was average at best, the bruschetta were tasty enough but the pasta dishes (lobster raviolis with clams for my wife and mushroom raviolis for me) were bland and uninspired.  The tiramisu for dessert was the worst tiramisu I've had in years.  It was heavier than bricks and the cream tasted like a fatty butter cream (do they even use mascarpone?).  Not worth the $22.95 price tag for a ravioli dish... Not in the least.",2
"This place is like a glorified bowling alley snack shop with overpriced, bland daily specials. They keep food on unappetizing buffet trays sitting out so long it often gets dry and overcooked. The cashier wears very tight, revealing shorts year-round including during the humid, sweaty summer months -- who wants to see that? Cover your legs and your cleavage! I almost always see her chewing and wiping her mouth while working. If you are hungry at work, take a lunch break and go off the clock! Don't talk to customers with your mouth full while you charge them. Too much multitasking. Many of the surfaces feel greasy. The menu is complicated. The place is often stifling hot in the summer or super cold in the winter. I got extremely sick here from their salad bar. Also, the bottled sodas here cost 15 cents more than in the vending machines at Corporate Square. Don't waste your time or money at this filthy place that takes its customers for granted.",1
"The woman Doris is very disrespectful.  Several times I've had to stand and wait while she flirts with the guy in line ahead of me after she's already taken his order.  Then the customer is always the one who stops the conversation so that I can order, not her.  She just sneers at me without a greeting.  I come in every week and watch her treat all her other regular guests with warmth and respect but never towards me.  Today she charged me more than usual.  I'm not sure what I did to this woman but she will never get another dime of my money ever again.  I can make my own damn croissant sandwich...",1
"Campaign for real fish and chips continues..

Now, a little background..my family and I have been coming to this place for over 20 years

It has always been excellent, perhaps the best fish and chips in the lower mainland..bar none. And yes, none of that AYCE nonsense. Just traditional, solid fish and chips

However, recently they changed management..and I've been back twice since the switch. Plus I moved down town, and it's quite the trek

First time it was ok, but left me thinking what had happened to the quality of yesteryear 

Most recently, decided to give them another shot..despite the disappointment with the new management. Went on a Friday, and it was dead..should have been a sign

This place used to be hopping on a Friday night..line up out the door

We ordered one piece Halibut, and two piece cod..with chips and coleslaw

Chips were decent, but the cod was VERY greasy..all batter..little fish. Halibut was better, but still greasy. When I was finished, you should have seen my plate..it was literally all greasy batter. Coleslaw was blah

So yeah, disappointed. Not the same quality as the previous management. I won't be back. Shame",2
"I do not get the Greenhouse love.  Overpriced, bland food.  Long waits.  Inattentive service.    

The only thing it  has going for it is the location.  It's in the perfect spot to meet up with people and have a bite to eat.  And since the food's inoffensively basic American fare, it'll be OK with everyone in your group.

Even the breakfasts are mediocre, and it's hard to miss with breakfast food.  The eggs are thin, the bacon's overcooked, and they only have artificial ""maple flavored"" syrup for the pancakes.    Yet there's always a line to get in.   Again, it must be because there's no place else to go.",1
"We went for breakfast, and neither one of us left very happy.  

Good to know:  cash only, no bathrooms, and you're practically in on the conversation at the next table over.

The breakfast was fine ... nothing special, same with the price (maybe a little high for what it was).

The pastries and cakes are good for ogling, but we didn't try any.",2
"A coffee shop with no bathroom.  Genius!  Overpriced sandwiches that aren't very filling and the servers couldn't care less about you.  This place must only be in business due to its location.  That said, people do wait in line to get ripped off here.  Two stars for doing the all-natural/organic thing.",2
"I'm not paying 8 bucks for a disappointing club sandwich. Sorry guys.

This place has mediocre food and high prices. The breakfast food is marginally better than lunch or dinner, but still nothing to write home about.

The only saving grace (and one that still won't really get me to go there) are the desserts. The cakes there ARE delicious. So, if you have a couple of dollars and want a late night slice of chocolate double layer and a cup of joe, this might be the one use for the Greenhouse.",1
"Greenhouse has this strange cult following which is the only reasonable explanation of how a place with no restroom, only accepts cash, and serves uneven food could survive in Harvard Square. 

The servings are big and they are moderately priced. Yes, it is a diner and that's its job. However,  I have had better-tasting, even much better-tasting, diner food.  But the place has it devotees and I have had to endure this place (After the last visit I drew the line). 

The problem with big is that I don't need leftovers from breakfast. To Greenhouse's credit, the food has arrived hot. But the potatoes often taste strange, like the oil is tired. Coffee is really bad. 

I know that lots of folks have strong undergraduate memories of Greenhouse. Some memories don't have to be relieved.

The tuna-melt here is passable. They rely on volume, like many  NYC delies. But like many NYC delies, I wish for less non-impressive bread for a tuna melt and less indifference to the ingredients. Greenhouse has the same homage to the big cake that NYC delies favor.",2
"When I first got to Cambridge, I always found myself going to brunch at the Greenhouse even though it was overpriced, unappetizing, and only takes cash (with no atm in the restaurant.) Don't make this mistake! There are so many great places in the Harvard Square area to get a decent brunch for the same price. On a sunny day, hit up High Rise Bakery for your choice of fine sandwiches, pastries, or some great oatmeal . . . while enjoying the outdoor patio. Want a mimosa or bloody mary in the Square? Then your best bet is Daedalus on Mt. Auburn. If what you're really after is a cheap and tasty brunch, get on the T and head to Central's Brookline Lunch....for price and taste I'd put it up against pretty much anything. Don't give up and end up at the Greenhouse, only disappointment awaits a meal there.",1
"Can I give this place negative stars?  This is the only place in MA that I fight the urge to sneer at every time I pass by.  Yucky, runny, soggy eggs and toast.  The coffee is terrible with a capital ""ick.""  Seriously - the first taste made me shudder.  If you make it through a whole cup, don't worry, they'll charge you full price for a refill.  And they are really unfriendly to outside coffee cups: they have a whole trashcan full of cups from peet's, starbuck's, au bon pain, tealuxe, etc.  The service was awful and they charge extra for everything!  Has Bush rationed syrup for the troops?  Free syrup for everyone!",1
"i hate to give a bad review, but i work in a restaurant and when i see the owners being so mean to the patrons as well as the staff, i take issue. the food's pretty good, and i admit, i do like their coffee, but the atmosphere when listening to the owner talk down to people makes me cringe.....",2
"I've got one star for the Greenhouse, and that's for the decor, which is a wonderfully dated attempt at making the place look like, well, a greenhouse
But the rest of the things that make up a restaurant:
service- bad
food- bad
atmosphere- aside from the mirror paintings of plants, bad
And how about these fine details:  They have no bathrooms (grandfathered out of the law because they've been there so long) and there are really none nearby.  And, they don't take credit cards, cash only.  Cash?  Who carries cash?????
So, either you can get all mushy and sentimental about how Harvard Sq isn't what it used to be (and it isn't, trust me, I've been here for a very very very long time) or you can accept that the mall culture is here to stay, and that the most unique things have to be snuffled out like truffles, open your eyes, and admit that this place SUCKS",1
Stunningly terrible. Gets my vote for worst restaurant in Cambridge.,1
"It is a shame that in such a great location there is such a bad restaurant. First of all they DO NOT have bathrooms!  Also they don't take credit cards. The owners are angry all the time and even when paying the bill they treat you badly. The food is terrible. The salads are disgustingly full of cheese. I am not super fan of cheese but even my friends who are, were not very excited about it. Plus with a name like Greenhouse you would think they would have great salads with a wide variety of vegetables. Salads for them are basically lettuce and tomato. I am never going back.",1
"One star for this place is way too generous.  They only take cash, but dont post this in a conspicuous spot.   I got stuck in Harvard Square one day and went in to Greenhouse buy a cup of coffee and then asked if I may use their restroom.  The waiter on staff looked at me like I was scum and actually SHOOED me away, flicking his hand like he was swatting a fly.  What a meanie!  I actually cried!",1
"I am glad it is gone. Review left for posterity. 

It just irritates me that the overall ranking for this place is two and a half stars. It should be well under 2, which is why I have taken some time out of my very busy day to write a review and push the little one star button. 

I miss the old Harvard Square, but I wouldn't miss this place. It'd make a primo location for an American Apparel store or something.

With Leo's right down the street, there's no reason to go here and be subjected to bad service and the thimbles of juice. It's worse than Friendly's, and that's saying something because I hate Friendly's.

If I ever use the word ""sammy"" in a review, track me down and choke me with some food from this place. Christ.",1
"Good thing I happened to have cash on me. Sorry, I didn't look at Yelp before some friends went here for breakfast today, won't happen again.

Don't think I'll be going back. First off, when you say you have fresh OJ on the menu, that usually means you squeeze it yourself. When they brought out a cardboard pint of Tropicana I was confused. My friends weren't impressed with their ""large"" drinks either. 

For the price, you do get a decent amount of food for breakfast, so I didn't leave hungry...it just wasn't that great. For brunch on Sunday a better bet is Johnny D's in Davis",2
"Belated review, but I can't help to join in on the way too late grave pissing that this shithole deserved. Food was awful, service was beyond abysmal, and the prices were skyrocketed high. I wasn't around for the ""old Harvard Square"" enough to give a judgement, but you have to say, what are you really missing here?

Good riddence to bad rubbish.",1
"I feel like I have to give this place one star in memoriam. Or maybe it should be five, since it's happily gone forever? I don't know. I can't stand places that make it simply because of an amazing location and despite pitiful service and terrible management. That irks me to no end. This might be the first time that I've used the word ""irks"" so satisfyingly.

I take solace in the fact that so many people share my opinion of this now extinct establishment. (I am rocking the assonance today!) Anyone up for a party at whatever opens in the location? For real.",1
"Greenhouse, I spit on your greasy, overpriced grave.",1
"i used to go here sometimes in college, the staff was not too friendly but we still went there for some readon.  then one day i was sitting there eating w/ my friends and i saw the guy (the one w/ glasses who is always there near the counter) pick his nose, right there, in midbite- i saw him pick his nose and then serve a customer a desert (with his booger-picking hand). I never went back.
grosssssssssss",1
"Wow.  How do you screw up a grilled cheese and rice pilaf?? The grilled cheese wasn't even melted, and the waiter acted as though there wasn't anything he could do about it.  Food and service you'd expect at a dingy truck stop - what are they doing in the middle of Harvard Square?!",1
"I had breakfast there for a while but also had mixed feelings about the place (as the negative comments in previous reviews were obvious to me). Then, it took just one visit (the last) to tip the balance toward the con's:

Everything was great with my regular waiter, he knew me and was ahead of me every time... this time I sat at a different table/area and had to suffer the new waiter's indifference and antagonism...
The place is not cheap, however, after the second cup of coffee the aforesaid waiter indulged in advising me of the extra charge (1.25 for a small cup, that was news to me)...
The owner's attitude...reminding you how a big favor she is doing to the world, and what I learned while in line to pay: no, she will not sell you an English muffing with eggs and cheese outside the ""combo,"" as she turned down the request of a customer.

Bonus bits and pieces...food is just fine; no restroom; poorly insulated (don't sit at the wall tables in winter); flies in some wall areas (I imagine there's garbage cans on the other side); cash only.

So, there it is...if you like your eggs with an attitude...",1
"You do not go to the Greenhouse Coffee Shop expecting a gastronomical event.  You go to the Greenhouse Coffee Shop for a delicious piece of chocolate cake and some coffee.  You go expecting sticky tables and spots on your silverware.  You eat your cake, you look out the window watching the brilliant mix of Harvard Squares and you eat your tight cake.   
Gary read a few things on poor service and Gary needs to speak out.  The man who brought a delicious mountain of chocolate cake to Gary's table was probably the sweetest man ever.  He was quick with coffee refills, made friendly banter, and even cut Gary a deal on the a la mode (sometimes you need a little something extra with your chocolate cake mountain).  When asked about the location of the bathrooms, Gary will admit his chocolate cake smile turned momentarily into a frown.  However, the waiter was quick to point out alternative bathroom locations thus turning Gary's frown right back upside down.  
As for the no credit issue?  Gary burned off a whopping 3.4 chocolate cake calories jaunting to the ATM across the street and used the change to cart his bloated, sugar coma self back home in a taxi.",2
"thank god this place is finally gone.  i know, i know, harvard square ain't what it used to be but this time this change is for the better.

i came here with my roommate back in my sophomore year of college because we lived right outside of harvard.  i wish i had yelp in my life back then because we would have gone to one of the billion other places to eat.  

the common theme here seems to be that on top of the rude service and lack of someplace to empty my bladder and then stare at my face for twenty minutes, they screw up really simple food.  bad toast?  grilled cheese not actually grilled?  i will now add to this we had the worst omelets i've ever come across in my life.  if there's one thing that totally sickens me, it's runny eggs.  i ALWAYS specify when i'm even craving them enough to order them in the first place that i want them cooked.  thoroughly.  

the fact that they couldn't even get the three ingredients i asked for in the omelet right was bad enough, but aside from the inch on either end,  the rest of the omelet was not even cooked.  if i had wanted to eat the omelet more than i wanted to vomit on my plate, i would have had to use a spoon.   and they seemed to have forgotten the cheese as well, or perhaps i just didn't notice a few shreds floating around in my egg lake.

we had been eying the gorgeous looking cakes in the glass case up front, but after barely being able to stomach part of those omelets [that they also refused to fix, by the way], we just wanted out.  i was disappointed to read that they were dry and not up to par with their appearance, but i guess i wasn't surprised.   so, basically, paying mark up on food you could cook better at home, and crappy service to boot, lovely!",1
"Half star, really. Yeah,lol. These people absolutely suck.  I went in there with a friend, and after we had ordered our coffees, the waitress came over again and demanded, yeah, demanded, that we buy something else because they have a minimum of x amount of dollars that we should spend to sit there.  I wish she had told this to us before, I wish they had explicitly written this somewhere visible, and i wish i did not have that God awful chocolate chip cookie that could have been deadly if chucked at someone's head. The staff, the policy,and the cookies have all come from hell, and can go back there.",1
"What a poopsty.  First thing I noticed was the spotty silverware.  Thirty minutes into the waiting, I was wondering why people who came after me were getting the food before me.  The waitress didn't seem bothered by it though.  After waiting 45 minutes for my food, the waitress lady informs me that she lost my order slip.  THANKS.  I left promptly after that.  And whats with basing your restaurant in a greenhouse, WTF, do you see people eating in greenhouses, why would you eat in one, there are bugs (I did see a couple of flies during my foodlesss wait).  No bathrooms, and no credit cards (are you living in the 16th century, you have a window, do you see those cars out there, its the 21st century).  If I had a chance, I'd throw bags of manure in front of the place to keep people from coming to it.  Is there anything good about this place? Nothing, absolutely nothing.  This is Harvard Square, there are 1000s of other places to eat around here.  Don't make my mistake.",1
"You're kidding me right, 2.5 stars? In my whole life there has not been a point when  The Greenhouse was not the worst restaurant in Harvard Square. They won't let you use their bathroom! I want to be clear on this. They have a bathroom, they just won't let you use it. And, while they are not legally bound to provide a bathroom, there isn't actually anything stopping them from doing so. 

And another thing, the staff is so rude because the management not only treats them badly but also sets a bad example by treating the clientele badly. 

The fries are godawful. I can't remember what anything else tasted like but really, you can't turn around in Harvard Square without tripping over better food.",1
"Had to share salad dressing with table next to us & we kept having to ask for items since the server kept forgetting or bringing what we didn't ask for. Rice was over cooked & meat was extremely hard that I gave up eating my meal. All together, disappointed.",1
"This was not the best I Hop but, it was very popular while it lasted. It closed down a while ago. I wonder what they are going to open up there next. I reccommend others to go to the Norwood I Hop. Eventhough it gets a bit crowded, the food is very tasty!",2
"I'm a big fan of IHOP... having said that I must tell you this one is quite dirty, the service is definitely not professional, and even the food was below average. I had fish and chips basket, the fish reached temperatures upward of 300 degrees, whatever it was, it was enough to burn my mouth and tongue, and that set the theme for the rest of the meal. You can't really enjoy below average food when your mouth is burned. I wouldn't go here again. Maybe it was late at night, but still, we were paying for the food for heaven's sake, it wasn't free.",2
"Just thinking of this place makes me want to vomit.

Now I love a good IHOP after a night out but when a couple friends and I stopped here on our way home from RI we were in for quite a surprise.

First of all this place was dirty and the waitresses appearance was way under par. I'm sorry but I don't think that looking for good personal hygiene in a waitress is too much to ask for. They both looked sloppy and dirty - giving off the feeling that they honestly couldn't give a shit. Which they probably don't I mean look at where they work but whatever it was their choice. If we hadn't been searching for a place to eat for hours we definitely would not have stayed.

By the time our food had arrived we had all lost our appetite and I don't remember any of us actually eating a whole lot. We payed our bill and ran home to shower and puke.",1
"They are now out of business, the building sits empty.

The place was god awful, and this outcome was expected.",2
"Ok, I understand there is not much variety for food in the Kendall Square area but this place is not really all that good. I have been in Kendall for over 7 years and at first I used to go here because it was a lot better and cheap, than you have an ownership change and the quality of food just isn't the same. The last few times I've been there I have been very disappointed, so it's been quite a while since I've been back. Also, some co-workers have tried to go by for some slices in the past few weeks and the place was closed at peak lunch hours, not sure what that is all about but it does make you wonder.

UPDATE: A co-worker of mine saw them removing chairs from the restaurant on January 24th, maybe they are remodeling or actually are closed.",2
"This place is absolutely horrendous if you're planning on eating. A smoothie is the only item on the menu that's worth the trip, but since Boston is usually cold most of the year, your best bet is to sprint somewhere else and forget the place in its entirety.. But....just in case you do eat there, I am warning you, you will feel sick to your stomach when you come to the realization that in a matter of five minutes  you just stuffed yourself with a big buritto full of absolute crap, down your throat. The salads appear fresh, but when you taste them, they taste mushy. The dressings are really oily, and the teriyaki in the Asian burrito is way too sweet. It's almost as if someone poured a pack of sugar right on top of your burrito. I know I'm being a little harsh, but I seriously can't understand why the line is practically out the door when I come here. 
 P.S. They only have white rice unlike the Purple Cactus which offers you brown, and they only have two tortilla options.",1
"Forget this place and go somewhere with better food at half the price. The smoothies are devent, but like the rest of the stuff here OVERPRICED. The burritos are mediocre at best. Since when does it cost so much for some beans and rice wrapped in a flour tortilla??

The veggies never taste fresh, which is a huge part of good simple cooking. The chicken is and beef are bland.

If you like this kind of stuff, go to Anna's. Skip The Wrap-- overpriced bad food.",1
"I went to Roy's this past weekend on a date, and it was not the wonderful Roy's experience that I usually have. I'm giving one star for the great cocktails and one star for the food  The atmosphere (which is usually lively) was V-E-R-Y depressing in such a large space, kind of like Jack Nicholson sitting at the hotel bar by himself in ""The Shining"".  It was REALLY slow for a weekend night.  The piano player in the bar was dreadful! I think he's fired up for the Paul McCartney show on the 15th, because he played about 4 Beatles tunes practically in a row.  Seriously, that guy is as creepy as the dude that plays music at The Tavern at Phipps.  My friends and I practically live across the street and we usually love this place, so I hope that they can rebound and get their groove back.",2
"Just bought 2 beef and been borritos. Freaking Nasty!!
Whatever was in them was rotten the tortillas was covered in what looks and smells like axle grease and crap!!.  My dog wouldn't eat it.
And as far as there hamburgers, if you like fake meat bad tomatoes and burned buns. 
This would be your place. 
If your hungry I would suggest the Porta potty at the construction job down the road.",1
"Now known as UFood Grill, the gimmick for this place is regular food with a ""healthy"" twist. They've got your usual burgers and fries and salads and all that but they supposedly make them better for you. 

I'm all for healthier eating (especially considering the obesity rate in this country) but as far as I can tell the stuff here isn't THAT healthy and it isn't really that tasty either. I also find it hilarious that it's right across from a McDonald's...which I would rather go to instead to be honest. 

For instance, I had the Chipotle Turkey Burger at 620 calories plus some UnFries at 225 calories. That's not really what I would call a ""healthy"" low calorie lunch. All the burgers are also around 600 calories. In comparison, a McDonald's Big Mac has 540 calories and a regular cheeseburger has 300. Say what? Yeah that's right, McDonald's stuff has less calories then this supposed ""healthy"" place. Granted the fries at McDonald's are higher in calories but you know what, the ""UnFries"" come in small portions, aren't that low calorie, and don't taste as good. 

My take? Too expensive (seriously go get the a burger off the dollar menu at McDonald's...less calories and like $6 cheaper) and it doesn't really live up to the healthy hype not to mention it doesn't taste amazing either. Save your money.",2
"Anybody for reheated leftover food? Throughly dissapointed with my last trip there. I ordered the chicken putanesca. The chicken breast was cold and dry and tasted like rubber. So I call the waitress and she offers to get me a new piece. 30 secs later she comes up  with a new piece. Wow thats freshly prepared just for me. The pasta and the sauce looked like a gooey mush. The Sonic next door  serves better frozen ""fresh"" food. My last trip to this place. Save your money.",1
"Gordon Ramsey would have a field day here. We decided to try the restaurant as we used to be regulars at the Y.

We sat in the UGLY Senoritas side and my husband ordered Mexican, I ordered off the Nunzia's menu. We ordered table side guac, that was not prepared tableside, but came out barely smashed and with no seasoning at all. I had to request some lime and smash it with a fork. pitiful.

My steak at $24 was very small and thin and a poor cut and overcooked. I had it with a side of greasy over cooked asparagus and the most Knorr package tasting pitiful excuse for a demi glace I may have actually ever encountered. I have had a better filet on an airplane.

My husband's fajitas came out dead and were terribly salty and had a weird aftertaste. His beans and rice were cold and the setup for his fajitas looked as if it had been sitting out for days with brown guac, wilted lettuce and the cheese was hardening.

The whole disgusting mess cost $56!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm just really, really mad about this and wish I would have just driven a little further into town. Why does everything out here have to be sub par??????????????????",1
"Sigh.  Another one bites the dust.

Seriously, I seem to be in a bad phase: almost every place I've gone in the past 2 weeks has either spiraled down into a hell hole or has blown chunks from the get-go.  Maybe it's me: maybe I'm PMS'ing.

The Y/Nunzia's/Senorita's....WTF??

Phase 1:  The Y  c. June 2005-May 2007

Eclectic, innovative food served in an architecturally beautiful building with a gorgeous bar and dining room, or outside seating amidst fountains, Onion Creek and a well-stocked (and extremely well-staffed) bar.  No turnover in the wait staff, on-hands engaging owners.

Phase 2: Nunzia's, c. May 2007-May 2008

Well...they dumbed down their menu and food cost by adding an Italian feature and trimming the number of selections.  The food is still good, but it's no longer innovative.  Some of the wait staff has departed.  The restaurant is much emptier on a regular basis.

Phase 3: Senoritas Cantina/Nunzia's c. June 2008-now

WTF is probably too base, too coarse, but...WTF???  One side has been turned into a cheap-ass Mexican cantina.  In fact, their lunch menu actually says El Cheapo.  I'm not making this up.  But, just to confuse matters, the other side of the wall is STILL NUNZIA'S.  WTF??  The only way you know (except by asking the obviously shell-shocked wait staff) is that there aren't tacky paintings and party-store plastic hot peppers on the Nunzia's side.  And the food??  Can you say Applebee's-meets-Taco Bell?

Obviously the 2nd owners have absolutely no friggin' clue why the restaurant they bought had clientele, nor any idea how to run a restaurant.  If this place is still open in 3 months, I'll be shocked.  It's no longer upscale, but it's too upscale to grab the construction crew crowd (I don't care whether it says El Cheapo on the menu or not), and it's too pedestrian to grab anyone with more than 2-1/2 taste buds.

Maybe 2 stars is 2 many.  I'll keep them there for the memories and hope someone buys this place who has any semblance of a clue.",2
"I agree - WTF?   Had an early dinner at the Y, aka Nunzia, now Senorita's?  Never saw a senorita and if she's the one cooking, the place definitely won't last.  Menu was unimpressive as was the food.  Prices way too high for what you get.  Their Mojitos tasted like watered down rum with weeds in it and at $8 each, we felt seriously jipped.  

Sorry, but it would be better to drive out 71 a little farther or simply stopping at the McD for a quick bite.",1
"The menu looks like someone took magnetic poetry sets for Sbarros, Boston Market, and Boloco and scrambled them all up. 

The choices are weird. Chicken parmesan...on a tortilla? With broccoli and brown rice on the side? It's like the meal I put together when I haven't gotten to the store.

Also, their menu includes things that do not sound like food. Several items include ""protein fuel"" or some kind of cheese called ""parmarella."" What??? You know that was mixed up in a lab.

Call me a hippie or a foodie or whatever, but I like eating whole, real foods I can identify. Also, if I want to lose weight, I'll eat *half* of a chicken parm sub, instead of a *whole* chicken parm tortilla shitparty.

I hate manly gyms, so I hated the atmosphere here. The presence of all those giant containers of protein powder and ""Meal Substitutes"" (aka energy bars) made me very uncomfortable. The music - and even the smell - made me glance around and make sure my H.S. gym teacher wasn't lurking, waiting to make me run laps.

The buffalo burger was passably good. No Big Mac, but tasty enough. For some reason, though, the patty was stamped out in a flower shape...which drew even more attention to the fact that it was a weird processed food.

Oh, and they don't have mayonnaise. SUCK.

They do use real plates and silverware, though. That was nice, but out of place.",1
"You couldn't pay me to come back here.

I don't know why people rave about this place - the lines are long, the food is mediocre, and the service is bad. Minus one more star for promoting their little GNC nook of crap in the same general vicinity of the food service area.",1
"I used to go here all the time over the summer, and never had a bad experience. Everything was very fresh and I found it all pretty flavorful. The burgers might not be a typical burger and the air fries might lack the greasy taste of Burger King fries, but Know Fat is supposed to be a healthy option for fast food. That being said, after having not been there for a while, I decided to head over today to pick up lunch. I got the roasted turkey wrap. I brought it home, unwrapped it and threw the whole thing away. I took one bite and had mayo dripping down my arm. Not ok. It was saturated. Now, i love me some mayo but not when its getting all over my arm. Plus, the wrap didn't even taste that great. I dont see how it could have gone SO downhill in the period of 3 months but it did. I dont think I will be back.

Despite my complaining, I will say that their health food shop is amazing. They have great bars and shakes. If anyone is really into fitness(like i am) this is great place to pick stuff up.",2
"I want to like this place more than I actually do. i like the idea of it. While the chipotle chicken sandwich is actually fairly good, other things are either bland (and healthy) or probably not that low in fat (and taste good). The thing about know fat is that the wait for your food can be pretty long... not great when you're trying to run in on lunch break. And the prices are  really high. Paying more than $10 on lunch in downtown crossing should never happen.",2
"Ehh. The lines are extremely long during lunch and the service is pretty slow. The setup of the store is also awkward as the order counter has a sort of cattle tunnel type that attempts to funnel people to the pickup area after they order.

I also found my food to be on the bland side. The upside is that this location offers some of the best people watching in the city.",2
"Low Fat Know Fat is the biggest racket on the modern downtown Boston lunch scene, and perhaps in Boston lunch history. A thinly veiled ""healthy"" fast food joint, this dump offers the same garbage of neighboring Wendy's but somehow dupes you into thinking it's good for you, justifying the jacked up price. Perhaps it's the ""educational"" menu boards or the protein powder and balance bars they sell in the corner (an odd thing to sell at an eatery!), but even a consumer with a keen eye for shifty marketeers falls for the gimmick.

 I ordered a burger and fries. My companion, a chicken burrito. The burger was ready in 3.2 seconds, which is not surprising given the careless nature with which it was prepared: bun not toasted, a tiny splurt of mustard (i only wanted mustard), and lettuce/tomato barely on the thing. I asked for more mustard; they doused it. The 2 dollar fries? They gave me about 10 of them, and they were soggy and (i could be mistaken) didn't seem very healthy. After the meal i felt gross, a very similar experience to the queasy post-McDonalds sensation. 

My companion writes this review-within-a-review: 
""I was starving, all I could think about was a sumptuous, (check sp) healthy meal...a monochromatic log of carbs was set forth before me - luke warm, with a reheated smell: white rice, yellow cheese, brown tortilla - where the f. are the greens? and not to forget the lycopenes i needed from the tomatoes. My first bite lodged itself in my throat only to be washed down by the over priced bottle of water. Did you guys have this burrito delivered up here by donkey from Mexico? yeah, it was that stale. gimme my money back.""

In sum, this place angered me so much because they blantantly leave their promise unfulfilled.  My friend closed her review with this line, and I think it's a fitting end to this rant: instead of KnowFat you should be called CarboLoad. 
Go away.",1
"This place is quite mediocre, they claim to be all healthy and stuff, I'm not too sure about that. They have these fries called air fries, I have yet to find out how are they different from other fries... they were not as greasy as some of the other places, this much I'd say. I had their Chipotle Chicken sandwich which was kinda dry and tasted ok. They have a complete supplements store inside, you can buy your protein shakes etc.",2
"Hey EVERYBODY! Let's all get HEALTHY********

But first come with me down my list of what we will need to eat first:

1. One large Chacarero combo with everything.

2. Large Sausage and Peppers from the cart next to Macy's

3. Falafel King roll up with hummus and everything

4. Lagrassa's large Turkey, Lettuce Tomato and Mayo

5. Silvertone Meatloaf w/ garlic mashed and gravy (have a Manhattan too)

6. Herrera's large beef burrito

There. Now we can begin.

Once inside KnowFat Lifestyle Grill .  Smell food, taste food

Puke everything good you already ate.

Go home thinner.

in conclusion - why eat here when there is GOOD food all around you.

and I didn't even mention Chinatown",1
"Uhh.. I'm not sure why anyone is under the impression that the food here is healthy. The reason they call it ""Know Fat"" instead of ""Low Fat"" is because they advertise the fat content of their food. There's an implied air of health, but that's all they are saying: we advertise how fattening our food is. Read the fine print and you'll see they make no claims about actually being healthy. And would you honestly trust the health advice of a place that also sells mad sugary, ultra-caffeinated drinks like Cocaine and ""Pimp Juice""?
This review just turned into a rant, but it's warranted. If you care about yourself, start going to the gym and stick to places that sell fresh food, like Wild Greens. No place on earth makes a healthy buffalo chicken wrap or a bacon cheeseburger. That said, the food isn't terrible but downtown is full of better lunch destinations. Sebastians, Sam LaGrassa's, Chacarero, and Mediterranean Grill are just a few.",2
"Gross.

There's just so much wrong with this place.

First: What the eff is with the GNC?
Second: $$$  What?!?!?
Third: Food is nasty.  

I got some grilled veggie sandwich mess and BLECH.  Limp wilted veggies (except the nine whole baby carrots) a mess of melted cheese and all of this drenched in oil.  Proof positive that you can't be ""healthy"" just by calling yourself that.  

I added the air fries and a soda on for $2 some odd dollars and they burnt the effing fries.  Is this is why they changed their name and added that ridiculous logo?  (WTF kind of name is UFood?  Makes me think of: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hufu)


Bonus star added since I didn't vomit afterward.  Though that may have something to do with not finishing.",2
"I've been to many locations from this chain in the past with my girlfriend and I can say that this isn't one of their finest ones. I've been to this one about 4-5 times and each time I've been there they have messed up our orders. Not only that but we also had to wait for them to fix it; they get very busy during their peak hours and even after messing up, they never gave up priority over the customers coming in and next thing you know we spent about a half an hour there waiting for our food. That's a long time considering the food they prepare there.

The food itself is decent although I find it a bit sickning after a while. For some reason everytime I get their burritos, the first few bites are awesome but by the time I get through two thirds of it I get really nautious. Can't figure out why but it's happened multiple times. Their steak tips are good and I really enjoy their ""air fries"".

One thing about this place which really sucks is the prices. They are very, very excessive. Grab a plate and a smoothie and you'll top off at almost 15-20 bucks. That's really excessive for what you get.

I guess Know Fat Low Fat was cool at first, but now it's just bleh.",2
"I'm all for the concept. Unfortunately KnowFat fails to deliver. Pay twice as much as you would at a fast food place for a meal that tastes half as good.  I've been there at least 5 times because I had a gift certificate, and for every dish I could have gotten something cheaper and better a few blocks away.

PS the Buffalo Chicken wrap is terrible.",2
"So, I was jonesing for some brown rice for lunch downtown this afternoon and I found a Yelp talk thread re: brown rice that suggested Know Fat.  I've had their fries before, they're decent enough, so I headed down to Know Fat.  I ordered their steamed turkey tender entree with brown rice and brocolli.  Blech!  The turkey was tasteless and a bit on the rare side (I tend to like my poultry thoroughly cooked, thank you very much).  The brocolli was limp and the consistency of the brown rice was closer to instant white rice.  That'll teach me not to scroll down all of the reviews before wasting $10+ (?!?!) on a barely edible lunch.",1
"When this place first opened it was one of my favorite lunch spots. It was inexpensive, the food was all made fresh, generously portioned, tasted great and was apparently healthy.  Ever since they expanded, everything has gone in the toilet.  Their prices are outrageous, their portions are tiny (their regular size wrap used to be their small), their food is rarely freshly grilled anymore, their chicken is frozen and rubbery, and overall their food has become very bland a boring. 

They're trying to make it more appealing with fancy plates and a nice presentation and now a new name (UFood), but it's still the same food.  At practically every location you can walk to 10 other wrap shops and get food that's 100x better.",1
"One last update:  I decided to try one of their shakes today because I was looking for something cool to drink.  In retrospect, I really should have seen this coming, but my chocolate banana protein shake didn't taste like chocolate or banana, but rather protein.  And not fun protein, but the ground up stuff that they sell in those massive jugs at GNC, or at the protein shop thing in the restaurant itself. 

Basically, I've had it with this place.  The food isn't that great, their nutritional info can only be ascertained via the brochure (and isn't all that appealing for what seems to be a healthy living place), and there's a GNC-like place in it, which I find disconcerting.  Blech.  

The service isn't too bad, which may be the only redeeming factor, but there are much better places for food in Downtown Crossing (heck, the Quiznos next door is better).",1
"This is your general ""healthy food"" place, though they seem to be a bit more gung-ho than a place like B.Good, primarily because of what seems to be a GNC built into the location.  That kind of frightens me.

I'll give this place some credit:  I like their fries.   And this location is relatively clean and well-kept, and the employees are generally nice. And they have Diet Mountain Dew.

The burgers are a little tough though.  It's probably more the bacon than anything else.  I mean, it's tough bacon.  Not Rocky at the end of Rocky III tough, but tough.  The fries are good, though.

UPDATE:  I took a look at their nutritional info (Unlike b. good, they don't have it listed next to the food on their large menu thing, but rather in one of those pamphlet thingies)  I like my healthy burgers, even the bacon cheese ones, to have a little bit less on the fat side than 22 grams (13 non-sat, 9 sat).  So I've adjusted accordingly for both reasons above.",2
"If this is what China tastes like then I hope to never go!

I work down the street from this place and decided to try it for lunch because I was pressed for time and assumed that it would be quick. I was right it was out very fast the staff was very friendly and courteous. Unfortunately the food was not so friendly. I ordered the General Tso Chicken combo plate. I have to say it was the worst I have ever experienced. This place makes Panda Express look like PF Changs. The chicken was soggy and the sauce tasted nothing like the regular general tso chicken I have grown up eating. There are a few other chinese food options in the area that are 10 times better and close to the same price. Hit up one of those. Do not be seduced by the $5.99 sign...the food isn't worth $0.59.",2
"DO NOT EAT HERE.

I've eaten here 10 or 12 times, and I STRONGLY WARN you to stay away!!!

This business started off with decent food at a very reasonable price. I kept going back because the portions were big. It was GREAT!

Then it changed in summer 2012.

Suddenly all of the meat is gamey and over-salted. Like rotten meat covered up with salt. Two bites and your tongue will not let you eat more. Last night was the last time I leave having only eaten the rice. 


*** The Travis County Health Department needs to investigate this place ***

*** SERIOUSLY ***",1
"Whoa!  This is some nasty stuff!   Seriously, this may be the worst Chinese food I've had.  Except maybe that time in the Denver airport...",2
"What is there to say about ""Taste of China express"".  If you are looking for cheap Chinese food, this place is good for that, but remember, when you have cheap priced food, you will have cheap quality food.  Unless you arrive when they first open for the day, the food will always look like it has been sitting all day. This food here is also Extremely Salty, so salty that all the food taste alike.  There lo mein, is always dry and there egg rolls are a joke. I have been here a few times to eat.  I am the type of person who will not judge a place on my first visit.  So all in all, the staff here is usually polite and friendly. The place could be cleaned better and the food needs a lot less salt.  PS, I recommend that if you eat here, be prepared to have a restroom nearby afterwards, if you know what I mean lol",1
"My expectation: ""Please don't be worse than Panda Express""

Expectation met. Barely.

This is a good baseline for mediocre.  Anything worse is bad, anything better is good. This place just leaves you whelmed.",2
Seemed like a bunch of gang members running the place - food was cheap - but not worth the price - real dirty and unkept - food was tasteless,1
"Dear god... no! VERY sweet friendly staff, but my tea tasted like metal or mold, the food was slimy and too salty, I came hungry and left with a sour stomach. Sorry taste of china, you're SO cheap it's tempting... but unfortunately, it shows.",2
"If you desperately want Chinese food and on a limited amount of time, than Taste of China might be for you but I would not say its worth it. The price for the items you get is pretty good but the quality is ok. You do get a large amount of food. 

The few times I have been there, I've only gone through the drive through and you can be waiting for a bit. The speaker box never works, so each person has to drive up and order. They seem to make your order fresh and it can take a bi longer to get your order.

The food is ok. Your way better off at going to Panda Express but if you need Chinese right now and in the area, it might be your only option.",2
"Are you in the vicinity of Congress and Oltorf and in the mood for good, authentic Chinese food? Sorry, but you're in the wrong part of town. Some would argue you're in the wrong city.

Are you willing to settle for average Americanized Chinese food? Go down Oltorf to New Mandarin. 

Just want something vaguely Asian? Go to the HEB next door to Taste of China and buy some frozen eggrolls or one of those frozen P.F. Chang's meals. 

Are you literally starving to death, to the point where you don't have the energy to crawl to HEB? Then maybe go to Taste of China. But do not, DO NOT order the eggrolls. I think they are made of Soylent Green.

Negative Ten Stars.",1
"There's good bad Chinese, then there's just, well...what can I say?
I got the general tsaobwith lo mein. 
It's was all balls of dough with a hint of chicken in the middle.  The sauce was standard one would find at any low end Chinese takeout.  The lomein was orange in color and over cooked.  There was probably no nutritional value in the whole meal. I picked out some chicken and left the rest there.  Well it was cheap I guess at $6. 
My diet Pepsi was good.",1
"Purchased lunch through the drive through window 2/22.

Got the General Tao chicken.  The chicken was chewy and the breading felt stale. I found that the chicken on the bottom of my dish was still cold / frozen.  The egg roll was cold and soggy.

Never again",1
"What a waste of space!! This place is obviously still owned/run by the former INQ staff.  I went this past Saturday night and what a nightmare.
The service on the patio was horrendous and the food was so inconsistent. The two apps we ordered: baked mushrooms and the eggplant were delicious but took forever to arrive.  My Fashionista salad came out with no mushroom bruschetta. I asked for it and when it arrived it was a piece of burnt white toast covered in mushrooms. My friend got the veal marsala and after the waiter delivered it he apologized for the small piece of veal and informed her he would be bringing her another piece. And then my other friend ordered the swordfish which turned out to be so overcooked he couldn't even eat it.  The waiter actually took it back to the kitchen. Another whole order of the swordfish came out and it was basically a completely different dish and actually delicious. On our way out the manager on the patio who basically stood around all night doing much of nothing apologized for the kitchen stating, ""I don't know what's wrong with the kitchen tonight. They are in their own little world.""",2
"****** Update
****** This place closed.....AGAIN!  Hah! They claim it's under new management and ownership from the sign outside! 

I think this corner of Newbury Street must be cursed. Every time this restaurants changes names (often...Saffron? INQ? See the Yelp reviews on those!) I give it a shot and then kick myself for doing it. So, I tried L&R for brunch. After about 15 minutes sitting down, our waitress came over and took our order for coffees, juice, and entrees.  Coffee took forever to get - we probably waited another 15 minutes.  A half hour *later* our breakfast came out. There are 2 types of frittatas on the menu; the wrong one was brought to me. So I sent it back.  My breakfast partner kept his, figuring mine wouldn't take that long.  TWENTY minutes later, the waitress brought my frittata. AGAIN IT WAS THE WRONG ONE!! Who does that?!!? So, I sent it back, asked for the manager, explained the problem, and they comped my entree. That is nice, but it was long after my friend finished his meal when mine came out. I boxed it to go and off we went. I do think the frittata was good, but so many other places on Newbury St are better and in the same price range. Service makes all the difference.",1
OmG I don't even know how this place is still open food is disgusting presentation is horrible that place is so abandoned and not even a renovation will help the prices are fake they false advertised lunch special but charge more at the register. The environment is horrible I am from pr and I will never call this place Chinese food from Puerto Rico,1
I will NEVER come back to this place. Ordered the lunch special and have never seen or eaten something this bad. The rice was burnt and the shrimp was not deveined. Pepper steak tasted like garlic gone bad. The fried chicken was ok flavor wise. Also ordered a side of French Fries and they were undercooked. How can anyone screw that? Like I said Chirico is not for me. Oh and this place is supposed to be a Chinese/Puertorican restaurant and it's just a bad attempt. I am from Puerto Rico and I can assure you that this is not how it's supposed to taste.,1
First off the lunch special is a just reheated rice w chopped pieces of sandwich ham and soy sauce . The back door of the restaurant was left open and I've heard from a friend who is an exterminator friend to stay away because of the pests . PR chinese from Ponce it is not. That's and old sign from the previous owner who is now is across the street.,1
"The food restaurant its very clean and neat but in the food quality they are getting bad to the rice they put much more basic sauce and the cabbage its doesn't taste good, when you talk to the receptionist she miss understand the  whole order i am disappointed about the food quality.",1
"This restaurant it's located in a area in Kissimmee where there lots of hotels. We spend closed to $40 dollars in food.  My husband got to the hotel and there were no forks in the bag. I called the restaurant and instead of getting an apology the person who answer was very condescending he told me, ""if your husband would asked for forks and by the way I have more customers I have to go"". Excuse me since when when you dine out and need to asked for forks?  Just saying!  LEARN TO TREAT CUSTOMERS RIGHT! By the way food was horrible the fried rice was burn, the orange chicken was nasty and the crab rangoon cream filling taste like it was spoil. Lucky to get 1 star!",1
Well this place didn't last long. I drove by and the signs are down and trucks parked outside. They didn't even make it to summer. UPDATE: I heard from the local gas station attendant that an illness forced the owners to close it. Sad.,2
"NOTE: This review has been updated to delete the name of the competitor since it was apparently deleted as being too much of an ad for that place.  You'll have to look it up yourself; it starts with ""Way--"".

To the best of my knowledge, there are two places in Portland claiming to serve authentic Chicago-style hot dogs: this place and W----.

Both are ""authentic"", but W--- is VASTLY superior to this place in almost every way.

The high point of this place is the Chicago dog.  It's pretty good, but just a tiny bit less fresh, and less tasty, than [you know].  It's as if, after you ordered here, they drove over to W---- and drove back with a Chicago dog and let it sit under a heat lamp for 40 minutes before serving it to you.  It's the only reason I'm not giving this place one star.

I also ordered the cheese fries.  The fries, I'm certain, are the kind you might buy in a 50 lb. sack from Costco -- completely average.  The ""cheese"" is the same stuff you get on your nachos in a movie theater.  W. has them beat hands-down -- with better fries and cheese that's actually quite good.

The atmosphere and decor here is similar to a generic, small-city airport bar.  It's a ""blank-slate"" restaurant with generic furniture and thirty pieces of ""Chicago memorablilia"" on the walls.  Wa---s may not win any awards for decor but it's light and airy and fun to be in.  Not so here.

(I should add here that I don't work for W----, but I have spent 25 years seeking out and sampling Chicago dogs and have a fair amount of experience with these types of places.)

Finally, I have to say that the employees here seemed bored and indifferent; whereas at, yes -- [COMPETITOR], the folks behind the counter really seem: 1) like they take pride in their food and 2) like they are really from Chicago.

Again, the Chicago dogs at this place are fine, and in a pinch, they'll do.  But if you're in search of the best Chicago dog in PDX, you should be visiting... (I won't even say it.)",2
"I have to kind of dissent, though if it were not so many positive reviews I might have given three stars given the amiability of the staff.  I've had a good amount of Indonesian food in Holland, all of which was richer, spicier, and better prepared than the borderline insipid meal I had at Jakarta Corner. To be fair, the price was very low, I've only been once, and I didn't ask for my food extra spicy. Perhaps I ordered the wrong things. But the ingredients, e.g., squid, shrimp, and white rice, were objectively dodgy.",2
"Oh my goodness!  This place should be called ""Grease Central""!!  Have been a few times, and can agree with previous posters that you WILL end up spending 1/2 the day in the bathroom after eating here.  The service staff is friendly, but the food will do you in!
My stomach and I will not be returning.  Good grief!",2
"I really didn't like the food here. I had the french toast, and it tasted EXACTLY like what I would have done at home (and that's not a compliment). I expect a little more from a breakfast place. If you're looking for a really good, satisfying breakfast, go to Marika's just a couple of blocks down the street.",2
"I have eaten here several times. Food is usually good. Service very erratic and depends on who you get. My go to meal is a grilled cheese sandwich with fries. How do you mess that up? Right?  I ask for a few pickle slices on the side, like the ones you get on a McDonald's hamburger. In the past they were free, like at every other restaurant I have ever been to. But about a month ago I noticed a charge of $1.75 on my bill. No kidding. For 4 pickle slices!  I complained to my waiter and he was able to knock it down to 75¢. I complained more and they took it off my bill. And I am a regular who spends a lot of money there. The might as well write on the check, PLEASE DON'T EVER COME BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN!!!  There are several other restaurants in the area that offer good service and fair prices. I would recommend giving them a try.",2
We will never go back. We waited for over one hour and never received our food. People had to clean their own tables. People got up and left because no one ever came to take their orders. We asked to get some sort of compensation and they didn't even offer to reimburse us for our drinks. Never again! I'm sitting at the Waffle House getting much better service!,1
"In response to Margaret H... I agree... was there sometime ago and I sat there for I know min of 20mins with no offer for even coffee. I'm the type of person that if I have coffee first I may forget about the time and not complain however in this situation the waitress (skinny lady with dark hair) had conversations with two different booths (small talk) and acted like I was never there. Now if she had come to me and said ""give me a minute I'll be right with you"", I would've been fine with that, but no...it was as if I was not sitting there at all (yes I'm black). Finally a guy (probably from the kitchen) came over and said ""oh no one is waiting on you?"" I said no. He finally got me coffee I eventually still ordered my meal and left but this experience there has never left my mind...even till this day as to how I was disregarded by her. She was at the booth right next to me and ignored me the whole time. At any rate, I've been there a couple of times since only because others choose to go there, but it's never been my favorite place. Right now I see they have a go fund me page to try to stay afloat, but guess what, I cannot and will not contribute. And trust me I am a giving person I just gave to a lady that I don't even know down in Florida whose husband just passed away so it's not about that. It's about how one is treated.",1
"Can't speak to the food. Service was so bad we left before ordering. This is a take-out place. Wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a nice sit-down meal or anything along those lines. I bought a restaurant.com certificate that we couldn't use on any of the thai menu and it was just 2 of us, so we weren't going to be able to get the $35 minimum order for the certificate. I'll go back with friends and try to come back to review the pho... but I don't have high hopes, unfortunately!",1
"After reading all the reviews for this place, it was all I could think about for the last hour of work, and I was psyched to try it. I called several times with no answer, and finally showed up... to see a sign on the door saying that after 8 years, they were closed.  Sorry guys.",1
"I got a restaurant.com certificate for this place so I could try it out.  My friends and I had checked out their menu online and wanted to get some Thai food.  When we got there and sat down to look at the menu it had a big disclaimer about how they were putting new restrictions on their acceptance of restaurant.com certificates.  The biggest issue was that they only allowed orders for their Vietnamese items.  That meant that roughly half the menu was off limits to us.  We were only interested in the thai items to begin with.  The certificate I had purchased said nothing of the restrictions,  and the waitress didn't seem to care so we walked out.",1
"It's a real shame that mostly-good food has to hide behind some bad attitudes and slow service.

You know it hasn't gone well when the Chef says your money is no good and asks you and your family not to come back, simply because you tell him politely about legitimate problems during your visit.

After an interminable wait to order, an even longer wait for the food , one of the meals having some dry items, and finally a trip to the dirty restroom with no soap or paper towels, I gave one of the people in charge some polite advice about how this reflected on the restaurant.  

The chef then saw fit to follow up by coming to our table, listening to the description of the problems and then arguing that we were wrong, that he was doing his best, and that we and everyone else in LO are too hard to please. Then he finally suggested we not come back.

If you want  some drama at breakfast (it was all G-rated, thankfully), go to this place and complain a little bit and see what happens.",1
"Very polite crew....
VERY average food.
Not sure what we expected but we came out of there a bit confused.
There might be some start-up pains going on here.
We might try again.?..?...?...?",2
"This place is terrible.

I live down the street and it's soooo disappointing that we can't enjoy this place.

For one: it's never open.  They have incredibly odd hours.  Also: The staff has been incredibly rude to us on the few occasions we attempted to go there (I say attempted because we were shooed (yes, SHOOED) out the door despite the fact that there were patrons in there... the lady said they were closed.  

We are very loyal to our local businesses and had high hopes to add this establishment to our weekly or monthly rotation - but no way.

I will never EAT at JOHNNY'S.",1
"To go into this location you must be white. If you are of color don't go. You'll be harassed by a little guy and his big friends..followed  out to the parking lot and made to feel unsafe! I always loved the Tyrrell room however not happy if they tolerat members of the organization. To treat people poorly after paying for a private party
Next time please put the white hats over your head so people will no in advance to AVOID!!",1
"This place has a vile manager in the office at night , I don't know her name but she is a filthy mouth unprofessional person. Not worth being in the same building as her . She is so unpleasant it is sickening. Try another lodge and be much happier.",1
"The breakfast here is so sad that it makes McDonald's breakfast desirable.

Breakfast burrito: $4
Vanilla latte: $3.50

The breakfast burrito is MICROWAVED! It had hash brown, sausage, egg and cheese. The hash brown is just shredded potato (not grill/pan fry in any way). The sausage was super processed. It was absolutely disgusting. Imagine sausage slices like the square sliced cheese, that is cut in triangles.  The sausage was not scramble patty.  Since all the ingredients in the burrito came out a fridge premade,     there was no flavor in it at all.  I ate half of it before I threw it away. 

The vanilla latte is just as terrible.

To use Visa, your purchase minimum is $5.

If I were you looking for breakfast, you would be better off going to the bagel food cart or potbelly.",1
"This was SO disappointing.  I got what was called a ""fresh baked muffin"" that was handed to me wrapped in cellophane and was obviously just a Costco muffin.  Fine, I don't mind Costco muffins, but it was FROZEN all the way through.  I also got an almond milk latte and it tasted so very watered down...I was not impressed at all.  There was no one else in there at the time...now I'm beginning to understand why.  I really had high hopes given the positive reviews, but I really wasn't impressed today.",1
"I was on a 15 min break yesterday and I went to Katie's . I ordered a sausage and cheese breakfast sandwich .I was just finishing up a phone call  but I was clear and told the lady who helped me what I wanted. when I get back to work I got a bacon and cheese breakfast sandwich . So I called Katie's and spoke to a worker over the phone . I explained the situation and the lady on the phone apologized about  the mistake and informed me that I will get a refund of my money or  they can just remake the sandwich . I told her I wasn't able to get to Katie's that I was on a break that I would come in the morning for another sandwich. everything was fine when the phone call ended.  This morning when I went in the owner was there and as I was explaining to her what happened . she  says ""where the bacon"" I informed her I wasn't told to bring back the sandwich so I ate it . I was on break and couldn't make it back over there plus I was hungry. So what else was I supposed  to do and they lady I spoke with never said to bring the bacon or the sandwich back. So the owner says  "" this time I will do this for you and make another sandwich . she placed the blame of the mistake of her employee on me as if I wasn't clear with my order I repeated what I wanted 2-3 times.  I have been going to Katie's for 2 years and I am shocked that I was treated so poorly. I will never go back there and spend my money with them.",1
"The best thing about this cafe is it's location. If you like food from Costco then you may like Katie's.  Nothing is fresh, it all comes out of a package or can, and frozen meatballs out of a bag  How can you mess up a BLT?  I've had several mediocre experiences here and go back because it's convenient.  Today I called to order a BLT and the person who answered the phone did not know what a BLT was, even after I explained the ingredients they asked me if I wanted meat or cheese on the sandwich. The do not have a toaster but use a pannini maker to lightly toast the outside of the sandwich. This was a really bad sandwich, whoever made it put the sandwich in the grill with the lettuce, tomato and mayo on it.  The lettuce was wilted, tomatoes were cooked and bare two slices of bacon.  I think I'll just bring sandwich making material to work instead of paying too much for something that is marginal at best.",2
"Cafeteria food, plain and simple. Not the school lunch variety, more like the hospital or big work campus kind, but cafeteria food never the less. It's the west side of 5th avenue's Rose's.

I first tried Katie's when I needed something super quick and someone suggested they're priced better than Rose's. They're not. They're priced differently. Rose's sells combos, Katie's goes a la cart. Some things are cheaper here, some things are cheaper there. Portions are about the same. $5.95 for cold cuts on regular sandwich bread is still a bit much. I'd argue it's a lower quality than Rose's as well.

The offerings are simple and basic: soups, salads, sandwiches and a couple specials. Breakfast offerings include bagels, breakfast burritos and quesadillas and muffins. Apparently you have to pick veggies or meat, or start adding items on at $.50-75 a pop, which is a bummer. At least Rose's throws some peppers in their breakfast burritos. Everything is incredibly average. There's a bunch of hot sauce to mask the complete lack of flavor. 

Staff is friendly enough. Lines move quick. They're got a much better than average selection of chips and drinks. Most things are made to order, not prepackaged. Still could be cheaper and tastier.

They also sell a selection of convenience store items, for those days when you need a side of tampons with your salad.",2
"This restaurant has been changed hands many times last few years. It never really kicks off and be competitive with other HK style like Copa, M Cafe etc. Not sure what but the food is just second grade to those restaurants. So if you can get same and better foods at Copa or M Cafe, why came here?",2
"This place is almost not worth eating had horrible service , barely any fresh food cooked , waiter was super slacking with refills , food isn't even that great , the desserts are just terrible , I would not recommend eating here again",1
"Stopped in for a quick lunch and my observation is this. Two stars is a gift.

1. Server did not speak English 
2. Food was luke warm / cold
3. Asked for melted butter for shrimp and they didn't have any butter? I mean how can a restaurant not have butter, either didn't want to accommodate or not telling the truth either way bad business. Didn't even go ask the kitchen after asking her if she cooked the food and said no.

Go to the one further down the road I am pretty sure they will have butter.",2
"This place use to be really good and my favorite. Now they change names, all food taste like covered in sugar and only got one refill.",1
"Gross..  just plain gross..

The food = gross
The restaurant = gross
The patrons = gross
The staff = gross

My first clue with this place should have been the door that is postered in pictures of people who have ""dined and dashed"" followed by about 20 different ""policies"" that the restaurant has.  Sitting at the sticky booth I was at and seeing hundreds of these ""policies"" I began to feel like I was at the chinese version of the soup nazi from seinfeld!  The food was absolutely horrible - and most of it was unrecognizable to me, someone who is far from picky when it comes to Chinese food.  

The ONLY redeeming factor here is the price - lunch buffet was $6.49, but honestly.. you can get a $5 footlong from Subway and not have to worry about visiting the emergency room after.  Stay away!!",1
"If I was starving and had only $6.00, and every other restaurant around was closed, I might eat here again.

There are quite a few oriental buffets in Central Florida.  Most of them serve the same selection of Americanized ""Chinese"" food.  What distinguishes one from another is freshness and quality of ingredients and care of preparation.  And, of course, how long they leave the finished product sitting out on the buffet tables.

We've eaten here twice.  Same issue both times - food is very bland, and obviously left out for far too long, as it was all overlooked and dried out.  

I don't really expect much from a $6 buffet, but this place is worse than the other buffet alternatives in the area.  Don't waste your time here - any of the local fast food alternatives will probably taste better.",1
"I've been searching for a ""go-to"" Chinese buffet in Orlando.
A buffet where we feel comfortable, safe and with good food (it wouldn't hurt to be nearby).

Enough to say, that the search is still ON.
Unfortunately, this was not the place for me.",2
"Went here after spending an hour or so at the mall......So here is how this place weighs in..

Pros:
-The Service is prompt and friendly....
-The Buffet is approx. $6.80 with tax

Cons:
-Very limited selection of Food...(Not even beef and broccoli, but chicken and broccoli?come on now....)
-The inside looks cheap and kind of run down...Not necessarily dirty though
-Not many types of meat that you can actually enjoy.  Allow me to elaborate...There was a pepper chicken or something of the sort...no actual meat...99% skin/casing for the chicken...The only meat I could actually taste was the General's chicken. (Somehow the general never lets me down)

All in all, you get what you pay for.  Its in a prime location, but I would rather hit up Wendy's or McDonald's or Chipotle with my $6.80.",2
"My girlfriend and I went here for dinner this evening, and I really wanted to enjoy it - it's not often to see a southern menu in Boston, and I was eager to replicate the great experience other Yelpers shared.  We had the goat cheese and pecan stuffed portobello appetizer, and the roasted duck and hanger steak for entrees.  The appetizer was fantastic; the mains were quite strongly flavored for my taste, and a bit mediocre on the whole.

The service we received was absolutely appalling.  Our waitress made no attempt to be polite, and seemed to have no interest in serving us.  At the end of the meal, after I managed to get her attention and ask for the check, she dropped it off and beelined for the bar to have a dinner of her own, which marked the end of our interaction.

It's unfortunately that poor service ruined what could have otherwise been a rather enjoyable meal.",2
"Sometimes service can be more important than the meal itself, this totally holds true for my experience at Magnolias. My boyfriend and I went there on Friday night and it was surprisingly empty, only 4 tables had diners. This is usually when you get the best of service...

I felt like our server had no desire to serve us, like we were inconveniencing him in some way. It was like we were getting a constant internal eye roll from him. Sorry, I understand that you're pants are vibrating and you'd rather go send a text message (which yes, I did witness), but I'm pretty sure your reason for being in this restaurant right now is to help with those dining here. 

It started with the drinks, my boyfriend's beer arrived with something floating on top, and within. He nicely pointed this out, and when they returned with a new beer we new it was the same one, they just spooned off the top and added more.

The food was OK, but I wasn't blown away by it. I wanted to love the avocado, but I felt the batter on it tasted burnt. I'm OK with this as the last thing I need in my life is a love affair with more fried food. My main course was the veggie platter, which was also mainly fried and just too much. My boyfriend thought his meal was OK, but nothing he'd go out of his way to get again.

Dessert was ordered, key lime pie, which wasn't only verbally ordered but also totally pointed to on the menu. What arrives, pecan pie of course. We pointed out to the server that we ordered the key lime, which we go the look of ""no you didn't"" paired with the internal eye roll. The key lime pie arrived and I think it was the highlight of the meal.

Then the bill arrives and suddenly our server turns pleasant.  It's funny how the tip is equated in their mind to handing you the bill and not the experience in total. I have to say, there are way too many restaurants in that area for me to go back to this one again.",2
"I wasn't as impressed with Magnolia's.  I feel there are definitely better places to go and eat.  It's hard to get anything but the real thing (by going to the Big Easy) if you're going to go out for cajun.

The best thing though was that they had Blackened Voodoo Lager available.  What great beer!",2
"Rhumba used to be a bar, food place that was packed; now it no longer exists. 

Which is somewhat surprising really....packed....out of business....eh?

So I thought I would get it out there that you shouldn't go looking for this place, because you won't find it.

However, there is a new business on the corner of pearl and...10th? which looks much like Rumba, and not just because it shares the same building, so go check the new place out maybe.",1
"I ordered Yakisoba with tofu. It was closer to 8 and the lady said that they close at 8:30. So I was like ok that's enough time to eat but noted that was not very friendly to say. When food came out. Quickly I should admit. After having couple bites it left very unpleasant bitter taste like burnt oil. So I couldn't eat it. I came to the counter and told them that, hoping they will make something else but they said that they can't help me and were very defensive. No dinner and they didn't return money. So I left still hungry. Not coming back",1
"I hate leaving bad reviews.  Well, this isn't really bad, but it's not good either.  Ordered the yakisoba noodles with chicken to go.  Bland.  So very very bland.  Maybe if you go, order this so-called secret sauce on the side, if not be prepared to doctor it up at home.  At $8, I just don't think it's worth it.",2
"It was alright.. Not really that impressed with the food i received (chicken yakisoba). It tasted decent but nothing really that spectacular. 

The inside was small and a bit dirty. There was a gnat flying around my food. The price was pretty good. The menu was adequate. 

Typical teriyaki joint with unspectacular food and a somewhat cramped, dingy inside. Probably won't be back.",2
"Meh.  That about covers it.  Food was okay.  Not really good, not really bad.  Bland, small portions.  Too many teriyaki options on 82nd for me to come back to this one.",2
"Not a great price, not super clean, staff was okay. My chicken was basically frozen still, completely pink. Had one bite and almost threw up. Ended up being sick the rest of the day.",1
"Got the chicken katsu and the only good thing I can say was the portion size was good. The chicken was super tough, overcooked and beaten flat. Couldn't even finish it. Definitely will never order again",1
"Be careful what you say at this place!! They charged me FULL dinner price at 11am (lunch hour) when I failed to say I wanted the lunch price. When I asked about what she charged me say stated ""well you didn't say you wanted lunch"" Hello?! It's 11am, not trying to have dinner yet. Not at all a friendly place either. There are soooo many other Teriyaki places around. I will NOT return and I don't recommend! I will forcefully give them 1 star but if I had a choice I'd give them NONE. Now I know how lame businesses try to stay in business, by overcharging guests!",1
"Atrocious.  Stay away!

I organized a high-end dinner party for 18 people. Thought Don Pepe's would be a fun and light atmosphere where the owners take care of their patrons. They do not.

Not only did I confirm the reservations in person the day before, I also dropped off two cakes to be served at the end of the meal. We reserved their ""private"" room (just a quieter portion of the restaurant) and I also left a detailed note on the two cakes stating our name, the date and time of the party.

Showed up on time with 18 people in tow. THEY DON'T HAVE OUR RESERVATION. Turns out they keep two books and did not transfer our reservation from one to the other. Another party was in our space and they were clearly 45 min to 1 hour from finishing.

Now I understand that this type of thing can happen, but their response to this problem was unacceptable. The manager (Luis) remained hidden in the back office instead of being an upfront man and at least try to offer any support or hospitality. I am a business owner and, if the same mistake happened in my business, I would be the first one out there offering a round of free drinks and moving my butt to fix things. Instead the staff was disinterested and borderline rude. Don Pepe's allowed 18 people (wealthy, connected and influential BTW) to stand around until we just left for another restaurant.

Upon further review after this debacle I determined that the manager purposefully did this to work in some family friends. When the cakes were returned the note detailing the time and date of our reservation was suspiciously missing.

Mistakes happen, sure. But to do this purposefully and put out 18 people who are now going to make it their mission to tell another 10 people (180 people total) plus this scathing review on the internet (multiple sites) is idiocy. This restaurant deserves everything it gets and Luis should be fired. But it is probably a family-owned restaurant and they will just keep doing the same thing. Because of this I strongly recommend that you do not give this family any of your hard earned money. Go someplace good!",1
"Moving back to my beloved Portland after 5 years, I realize that I may have an overly optimistic, sunshiny view of this city.  I love the rain, the friendly people, ubiquitous cute coffee shops, and trees.  After a relaxing and nostalgic walk through Waterfront Park I decided that a nice family dinner at Stanford's would add that perfect cherry to the delicious sundae of our outing.  I have been to Stanford's before for dinner and happy hour and have never been disappointed in the past.  Little did I know that I was about to have a cold slap in the face that brought me down from my happy cloud of Portland love.  We waited about 20 minutes to be seated, which wasn't a huge problem, but seemed strange since many tables were empty.  We sat down, ordered our food and patiently waited...and waited...and waited.  After almost 40 minutes had gone by (during this time we searched for our waitress and after that any waitress, sadly to no avail) I finally asked the seating hostess what the problem was in my most polite voice.  She brushed me off and said that she would check on our food.  We then saw her sneak into and quickly out of the kitchen, apparently without checking on anything, and walk the long way back to her desk, avoiding our table.  Wow.  Finally, 45 minutes after being seated we got our food which apparently had taken so long because everything was overcooked (the waitress did not offer any explanation or apology for this delay)!  My tuna (which I ordered rare) was so cooked it could have been straight from the finest can of Chicken of the Sea.  My dad's BBQ ribs were chewy and dry and my mom's burger was tasted like it came from McDonald's which would have been fine if it had only cost $1.  I had to try really hard to get my Portland glow back after that depressing evening.",1
"I have to go with Jen on this.  I should write more updates, but, then again, there's a lot of stuff I should do other than play on my computer too..... 
Anyway, Stanford's on the Waterfront is the only one I have been to, but I agree, it has taken a total nose dive.  Service has gotten slower & less attentive...... I didn't know that was possible!  Even the French Onion Soup isn't as good.  The last time we went there, the manager had to take it off the bill.  it was just awful.
However, HH prices are good, & if you just wanna hang in the bar, grab a bite & a beer...... it's still OK.",2
"When I read my review it was whiny, so rather than complain, shall we play a game?  Match up the restaurant dialog with the activity:

A:  ""Remember, honey, we used to consider this a nice restaurant.""

B:  ""Hey, I saw people at the bar watching basketball.  I'm going to the bar to hang out.""

C:  ""Someday, that boy is going to make a girl very happy.""

D:  ""It must be very special food.""

1:  My son ate his ice cream sundae in a very 'interesting' way.

2:  The decision is made to zip on the bottom part of my son's pants.

3:  My response to the kids after an excessive wait to receive our food.

4:  We were the only customers in the restaurant for the majority of the meal.  My son started looking for entertainment elsewhere.

Enough silliness, here is the brief review:  Too expensive for what you get.  

I have no problem throwing down a little cash for a special experience at a nice restaurant.  I get aggravated when I throw down cash for a meh experience.  

I've been going to different Stanford's locations in Portland for over ten years with a mix of experiences.  It is best at Happy Hour or for a business lunch/dinner.  Otherwise, there are many better and more affordable options elsewhere.",2
"Let's just say I never have a craving for this place.  I have had the chicken salad sub a couple of times, but it seems like it might come out of a big white tub.  I also tried the chicken parm and thought...why did I bother to eat this?  It was made out of those round processed chicken patties that come on the yellow foam tray.  It's what I like to call cheap chicken parm...kinda gray inside like an old school McDonald's chicken nugget.  Yes it's cheap here, but you definitely get what you pay for, however the guys who run it are very pleasant!",2
"Violets is good for convenient breakfast.  Usually on weekends there is a 20 minute wait, which is almost always outside.  The building got remodeled but they didn't make more space for violets.  Unfortunately they had all new staff on our last visit.   The service was a disaster.   I miss the old funky staff; The food and the service went down a notch.  Will probably give them another shot in a few months to see if they got it all worked out.",2
"Don't get me wrong, I love the breakfast here, but after my last visit I won't be going back any time soon.  We sat down at 7:30.  We were greated at about 7:45.  We received our coffee at around 7:50 and told our food would be ""right out"".  We proceed to wait....and wait....and wait...no coffee being refilled...no water being refilled...wait....wait.  At 8:40 our food has still not arrived. No server has come by to say they are sorry for the wait...or to refill our coffee.  We get up to leave and the server asks if we want it boxed up because it is coming ""right out"".  I huffed and hahhed as I said yes.  
I understand that sometimes the kitchen can be slammed and things take a bit of time.  But all the guy had to do was refill our coffee and tell us things are taking a bit longer than usual, and here's a cinammon roll on the house to make things a little better.  But nope.",2
"So disappointing on many fronts...
I used to be an avid Violets fan but hadnt been there in months so when my partner and I took his mom there for Mothers Day, it was doubly disappointing. 
The wait wasnt bad. That should have been a clue.
When we opened up the menu, the prices had sky-rocketed up $3-4 each. I dont want to pay $11 for an omlette when I know I can get a great one at the Doug Fir for $7 or less!
The omlette was missing its goat cheese, the eggs were gross and runny, the hashbrowns were frozen, and the bread was boring! 
In addition, the coffee was weak!
I dont know if there is anything good I can say about the experience except the babies all around us were cute.
If you were a Violets fan before the change of management/ownership, dont go back. Its seriously depressing.",1
"our whole visit started off on a bad note and since this is my third bad visit in a row, I might be forced to avoid Violet's ::shrug:: it must be true what people are saying about Violet's. the service and food has gone downhill since the change in ownership. 

we arrived and of course were greeted by several others waiting so I went in and put our name down. noticed there were 6 people ahead of us, most of them with 2.5 people. figured 20 minutes. we were waiting outside because there wasn't room inside, a woman came out once to call a name (not ours). when the inside cleared a little we went inside to get warm and noticed that our name had been skipped and they had actually seated several (5) tables after us and were about to seat another. when we spoke up they were very apologetic and did get us seated right away, but why have a list if you're not going to use it? dismayed we sat and ordered coffee, trying to still enjoy our meal - I really talked up the cafe since my guests were from the west side. 

I ordered the baja, basically a build-each-bite burrito breakfast. it's always good. they ordered an eggs benedict with a hollandaise sauce: one had roasted veggies and the other had smoked salmon. first the eggs benedict were cold and the hash browns barely browned, but at least they were hot. the roasted veggies were delicious and perfectly roasted but mostly she was disappointed in their temperature. the smoked salmon, probably refrigerated, still felt fresh from the fridge -- also disappointed. 

I only got offered 2 refills on coffee and sadly this woman who was walking around with the coffee pot, went to the table on each side of us and ignored my cup when I put it on the edge of the table. the absolute worst part of the meal was the side of fruit we ordered to go with our bill... we waited (and I'm being forgiving) 10 minutes for fruit in a to go box. 

will they ever trust my breakfast suggestions again?",2
"I grew up on eggs, bacon and a nice slice of wheat bread for breakfast every morning - so I think I know a good basic breakfast is all about. 

This wasn't it.

My scrambled eggs most definitely started off as a fried egg, then at some point the cook must have read the ticket again and changed it to scramble. Turns out scrambled eggs that are made up of yellow and whites are not appetizing at all.

I attempted to take refuge in the hash browns, but the grease was overwhelming. Then to the toast - no jam, but the pre buttering insured them to be soppy and well, frankly - gross.

A place I had wanted to visit for some time now, is one I will never have a kind thing to say about for breakfast. Next time, I need to check Yelp first. It was right here all along.",1
"We walked into this place, sat down, and after 5 minutes of squabbling with my cousins who came with me, we left. First of all, this place doesn't even  try to appear clean. The lighting looks like 40 watt fluorescent bulbs that cast a dim glow on the tables below. When I eat in Chinatown, where it's no secret that there are roaches, I like the lights bright bright bright so I can see what I'm eating and what's going on around me. My cousin said the last time he went, he saw a roach walking around on the window sill. Finally, we had to leave because the place seemed to have no temperature control what so ever and as soon as I sat down, I started sweating.",2
"I have a professor who likes to take our class here at the end of the semester as a grand finale to our memoir class. I've been now two years in a row and have dreaded each time. First off, let me tell you that the restaurant has a suspicious fish tank, the size most people keep in their homes, choc-full or larger fish. This strikes me as both inhumane and disgusting. I don't understand how broadcasting such a thing could be good for business. To top that all off, the first time I was there I witnessed a DEAD fish floating in the tank for the whole night. No one even bothered to take it out.

I don't know WHY I even ate on my second visit here. The thing is, the food isn't that bad. It's questionable and very cheap - a deadly combo. Just ask that fish.",2
"If it's late and you are hunkering for some good grub, then Chau Chow is the place to chow.  But this place has the best spicy salt calamari.  I would get that for sure if I was in town.  And its always fun to watch the fish try to get out of the tanks.  I would suggest going to this place during the day, to avoid like subsequent ratings have said, the evening crowd can get tough.",2
"As I commonly broadcast, I am a vegetarian. This means I do not eat anything with a face, yet I do eat eggs and drink / eat milk products.

On our visit to boston we hit up China Town for the good deals. We get hungry so I ask some people where the best noodle house is in town. He tells me the Grand Chau Chow and gives me directions. *

We get in and it looks a little rundown at best. We get seated and the waiters tell us we cannot sit in one chair as that it is ruined from a leak they have had. Why keep the chair there then? I wonder if we were a party of 4 instead of three if they would have told us about the damp / moldy chair.

So we drink our tea, it was wonderful. Then we start to look through our menus to order. I find almost no vegetarian selection. So our waiter comes up and I ask him if they have fried tofu for vegetarians he says they do. I am happy and order it. Then he tells me it has fish in it. I tell him I want no fish, he then tells me that fish is good for vegetarians and is okay to eat. Now im not about to discuss semantics with my waiter. So I tell him that all my food must never have had a face and I hope that solved it. So he writes down I want plain fried tofu. I order the vegetarian fried rice and with cuation ask him if it has any meat. He said no just fish. This became the routine for 5 minutes.

The conclusion is they can make everything vegetarian on thier menu at this location but they like to put beef, chicken, and mostly seafood in everything. So ask them to remove all meat and fish (specify that)

Side note my friend got the buddha's delight. Had to ask for the fish to be removed as she being Korea states there should be none in it. It somehow had beef in it when served. Buddha's delight is a vegan dish, its all vegetables and no animals or animal byproducts.

I am very unhappy with this visit. The prices were good for Boston though. I also enjoyed the tea and bubble tea. (the bubble tea is homemade at their location)

I am shocked and suprised to have see that it received an award for gourmet excellence from the Phantom Gourmet. 

If you love a cheap price for seafood dishes then this place cant be beat. If your vegetarian your going to have to argue to get your meal done without meat, and vegans I recommend you stay away. If I had to argue to get vegetarian imagine what you will have to do. 

* Also, if you are looking for a noodle house then this definately is not it. It have very few noodle dishes. So much for being the best noodle house. I will stick with Giant of Siam and Veitnam Noodle House in Nashua.",2
"Good for after clubbing. 

Average Chinese food with average services. I personally think the place isn't that clean. May be they need to renovate it and make the place fresher.

The calamari was good though.",2
"I had never been to Chinatown before, and the bf and I randomly ducked into this place because it was fairly full inside.

I immediately wanted to duck back out again. The smell was absolutely overpowering. It literally made me feel ill, and I was sure that I wouldn't be able to eat when the food arrived. It was none too clean, as our tablecloth was ripped in several places and the chairs were scruffy. It turned out that there were a couple of large family groups with a bunch of kids, and the atmosphere was definitely lacking. I would give it zero stars, if possible, just based on the impression after coming inside and the smell you have to tolerate if you're brave enough to stay.

However. The bf is a chef, and food adventurous, and I didn't want to embarrass him, so I sat down and ordered. I hardly spoke a word until the food arrived, and after it did, I was too busy eating to talk. I must say, the food was surprisingly tasty. I would never have expected tasty food, given the appearance of the inside of the restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised. And it was cheap. The bf loved his food, too, and was raving about how tasty it was. So my initial impression went up by a *lot* once we had eaten.

But then we left, and I had to deal with the food I had eaten for the rest of the night. My stomach was grumbling at me for hours after we left this place. My initial impression turned out to be right, and I probably shouldn't have eaten there. A day later, I'm still not feeling great.

So in the end, I give this place two stars - one star because it's cheap, and one star because the food *tasted* good while I was eating it. But to be perfectly honest, I'll probably never go back. Dealing with the smell and my stomach after we left just wasn't worth it.",2
"The food here is average in quality, but there are so many other drawbacks to the place that I definitely do NOT recommend it.  The first thing we noticed when we sat down was that the table was sticky... not a very appetizing way to start the meal.  The place is conveniently open late, but it also draws an undesirable late-night crowd.  For example, people at various tables were yelling loudly, swearing, threatening each other physically, etc.

Additionally, this unfortunate guy who was sitting next to us ordered a dish that he was told contained only cod, but it turned out there were also pieces of calamari in it--and he was allergic to it!  When he complained to the manager about this, the manager yelled at him and said that ""it all comes from the sea"" (meaning both fish and shellfish), which obviously does not justify exposing someone to food allergens!  Then some mafia-like figures started to threaten the poor customer because they (incorrectly) assumed he was trying to get out of paying.  Eeesh... This place is SKETCH!!!",1
"I have liked Scooter's since I moved to Austin and am happy to support the local franchisees. I usually find myself at the William Cannon location as it is on my way to work and the airport. I have fashioned the Oak Hill location twice over the past week and have been sorely disappointed. 

On Wednesday, I went in for a cup of tea. How hard can that be, people? Whoever was working did not know how to do it. I realized later that they have sort of a special situation with their teas. They put leaves in a cup, cover them with hot water, and top the cup with a filtered lid. This way the tea steeps authentically -- I suppose it's better without the bag part and the safety hazard of the staple. OK fine, I thought. So, I went on my merry way, enjoying my tea until about half way through the cup. At this point, the tea had over steeped and become so strong that I could not drink the rest. There was no way to get the tea leaves out of this contraption. So, no more tea at Scooters. Go back to bags, folks! 

I also shared a blueberry muffin, which was cold. My partner said, ""Their muffins are always cold."" I did not realize this issue in the past. So, I returned yesterday to see if it was really true. 

I had coffee this time. No more strong tea with the space-age filter lid for me, thank you very much. Again, how hard can this be? It's a cup of drip coffee. It was lousy, and I actually like lousy coffee as I am from New York. This was pretty lousy. Again, I drank half and gave up. 

Not to give in to the one mistake situation, I ordered a cream cheese and chocolate muffin. I asked, ""Is the muffin cold?"" I was told it was not. 

It was. 

So, I had to ask the barrista to nuke the muffin for 10 seconds, and that was fine. But, my partner was right, their muffins are always cold. 

Can we all get on with our lives and drink coffee from someplace else on the way down 290? Yes we can because a new Starbucks just opened up the street. I'd beware, Scooters. You just are not cutting it these days. Sorry. I want to like you more.",1
"Ok, So It's Monday Morning at 7:02Am, too late to make coffee and get to a early meeting, I pull into the drive through at Scooters off the Packed ""Y"" Oak Hill Jam, and order my coffee....

8 minutes later, watching walk-in customers get their beverages...I realize i had been forgotten. The girl was busy refilling the sugar thing, dreaming of the big-top or something. I wave, unnoticed. Fuckit. I drive off. Back to traffic, but no coffee. That kind of frustration will cause me to curse Scooters for decades. 

Screw You Scooter. Thanks for getting my Monday off to a great start.",1
"The coffee is ok. We buy mochas almost every day, and finally stopped going to Scooters because they just weren't that good. The service is consistently less than stellar - but not horrible. The huge straws for a 12-oz coffee (or a 16-oz) are cumbersome and weird.",2
"When i drive by, I still flip this place the middle finger . 
I hate you Scooter.",1
"I really wanted to like this place since I'd rather not patronize Starbucks (tho I will) and it's so close to my place. I have gone about 6 times...always hoping beyond hope that they will redeem themselves. 
Sorry...I'm done ~ not going back, nor recommending them...ever.
The service is slow, apathetic, the coffee is so-so, the food is over priced and never that appealing anyway...
I really tried to like it...I wanted to... :(",1
"I must disagree with my esteemed reviewing friends about this hole in the mall.  While overall La Salsa is a reasonable, fresh fast food place, this one sucks.  Big Time (as our fibrillating vice president would say).

The help in this place is the anti-help.  I've been in several times (my kids like it so I'm sometimes DRAGGED there) and every time the scowling burrito builder in the back makes the experience a drag.  He acts like he's doing us a favor by making our plate.

The last time that I went there the resulting exit of food from bowel was not pretty.  Went through several shots of Crate and Barrel odor killer (and still my dog got sick).  

I can't really rank this place.  It's rank enough to me already! 

Just my opinion - the other guys seem to love it.",1
"Because the Egg and I is close by and is something I haven't tried before, I decided to go with a few people to try it out.

I ordered the Eggs Florentine while a few people ordered scrambled eggs, toast, hash, side home fries...etc.  I saw the scrambled eggs and they did not look like they were scrambled.  They looked like the egg mix was spread on the grill and the cook folded it over and then chopped it up.  It was not fluffy and did not taste good.

Next comes some home fries.  They looked edible, but had no flavor.  It looked like they put too much paprika on it and then gave up.  So we piled on lots of salt and pepper.

Next, my eggs florentine.  What is up with it?  The Holladaise sauce was not good at all.  The spinach didn't look fresh and wasn't fully cooked.

Not sure if  I'd come here again.",2
"Seriously disappointed with Kirkwood Public house.  I loved Vinocity, the service was great and the food excellent.  i spent many a good night there. I went for a late lunch Saturday afternoon and was incredibly disappointed. I had to wait for the bar tender to turn around from the bar where he was sitting with his back to me watching TV with a woman, who I hope, was a bar patron and not his GF who came up to hang out. The server was run ragged and was totally overwhelmed- I really hope someone called in sick b.c if that is the level service I should expect...well, you have to be kidding me. My burger was over cooked and kinda gross.  I had an awful time. I am giving it one more shot and if it is like that again then I am done- I can't afford to waste money like that.",1
"I just wanted to give everyone a warning about dining at Vinocity in Kirkwood. This place is owned and managed by thieves. We recently ate there and the food was not good and was way over priced. But, that is not the worse part. We ate there on Jan 25, 2010. Later that week, I checked my bank statement and they had charged me twice for the same amount, on two different dates (the 25th and the 27th). I filed a dispute with my bank and they told me that the vendor (Vinocity) had swiped my card on the date we ate there and then 2 days later, they manually entered my card number for the 2nd charge. This means that they are keeping card numbers and entering them in on a different date for the same or different amounts. Please use caution when deciding to eat at this place. I don't want any of you to have to go through what we are going through to get this settled.",1
"This is not really a ""Public House"" in the sense of the word that many people know. Maybe in Atlanta ""Public Houses"" have flat screen TVs where people huddle around to watch the game.

The sliders were good and with a nice variety you don't get bored and can mix and match. As mentioned before there was a nice beer list but I was thrown for a loop with the amount of wine. Wine is an afterthought in a public house but they had a good selection. All in all it felt a little like a downtown bar trying to be a gastropub and it missed more than it hit.",2
"Our (Coan M.S.) first visit was enjoyable. Unfortunately, our second visit was quite disturbing.  As we were treated to a round of musical servers, few in our party began to receive their food.  After a long wait for the food, we were informed that not all dishes were prepared because the ""truck"" did not come in. In the utter frustration that the server(s) waited until we began to receive the food to inform us, we asked for the manager.  We waited for the manager to address our frustrations, yet instead we waited, and waited, and eventually had to called back to the restaurant and leave a message because (to our surprise 'wink') the manager was not available. So, we are still waiting for the manager to return our call.",2
"Overall assessment....not good. Went for lunch/brunch on Saturday. Ordered the hummus and a salad. Husband ordered the Kirkwood Quesadilla with smoked salmon, eggs, capers etc. 

Hummus was covered in this scorching hot sauce. Horrible, not edible. Had to return it and ask for another one without the hot sauce. Hummus was still too spicy and terrible, couldn't eat it. The salad was small and unremarkable especially since it was 8 bucks. UGH. Instead of what he ordered, husband got a quesadilla with black beans and cheese. We alerted the server who tells us that they stopped serving brunch early because it was slow. Ummmmm so two things: why did you let him order off of the brunch menu, then give him something else? Why did you give us a brunch menu if you weren't serving brunch? 

They were nice and did make him the correct meal though that he originally ordered and he said that it was good-ish, not great, but ok.",2
"Poor experience all three times:  run out of beers, had to send a hamburger back twice (how hard is it to make a hamburger?), and indifferent service.  Huge, pretty space.  Pity that it's practically empty all the time.

I really, really want to support local neighborhood businesses, but not at this rate.",2
"So my rents are on this quest to find great burgers in Atlanta.

They have been to several other restaurants and my parents invited the boy and I to join in this jaunt.

Upon looking at the menu we had many different choices of burger and the table decided to order a trio of their burgers to sample each one and then see where they were going to go from there.  The burgers were sampled and the decisons were made.

My rents and their friends got the normal burgers and the boy and I got the veal burger and the lamb burger.  Those were both tasty but from accounts from the other end of the table, their burgers were not.  There was much agreement that there was nothing special about their normal burgers and that their fries were sub-par.

In my parents conclusions they said that they can do fancy burgers very well, but if you can't pull off a basic burger something is wrong.  Also, how do you mess up fries? 

Then there was the waiter.  You know how some waiters can be funny and charming and insult you to your face with class?  This guy was not one of those people.

He would insult the table and try and laugh it off, but it wasn't funny or witty.  It was rude.  Then we would be talking about something and he would stand there and join the conversation.  Which in a laid back atmosphere is fine, but don't join the conversation and then try to tell us you know more about the subject than we do.  That was it: he wasn't funny or witty; he was condescending and annoying.

So in the long run, my rents are still on their quest for the best burger and we will not be returning.",2
"After working at Kirkwood Public House for one training shift, I decided not to go back.  The simple truth is, the place is filthy.  Dirty bar towels, dirty aprons, bathrooms and floors that never got a good scrub-down.  Dirt and dust everywhere. If you go in the evenings when the lighting is low, you may not notice.  But anyone who eats there is taking a risk.",1
"Came here with a couple friends and upon entering it felt like everything stopped and all eyes on us lol, it's a place for older (white) regulars. Didn't feel welcoming at all. Will not be back! The only positive thing I could say was the bartender was awesome!",1
Horrible service. Bartender/waitress seemed annoyed. Mashed potatoes tasted like mold and my vodka/club soda had no alcohol in it. I got cheese quesadillas and asked for no peppers and extra sour cream. Got peppers and no sout cream. Just horrible.,1
"CLOSED FOREVER 8-25-07
The family that owns V is taking some time off from the business. They sold the restaurant and a Chinese bakery will open up in the same space. 

sigh. I loved this place. We ate there on the last night, ordered all our favorites...they were as good and fresh as always.",1
"It looks better from the outside.  Because it is located in the Pearl district, you might be led to believe you will be in for an enjoyable meal in a nice restaurant.  Unless you have no where else to go, I wouldnt recommend this place.  It is like an Applebees or TGIFriday with a nicer sign above the door.  The food is nothing special, and the service the night I went was terrible.  The hostess had a major attitude problem, and throughout our entire meal, a man that I can only assume to be the manager came to our table about 5 times to ask how everything was.  I understand once or twice, beginning and end of meal, but it was just too much.  All we could assume was that he was bored and wanted to get some digits from my friend.  I definately do not recommend this place to anyone who actually goes out to enjoy their dining experience.",2
"Normally I wouldn't  bother writing about this less-than-zero mini-chain but when I noticed the average rating was 2.5 stars - remarkably low considering the ratings inflation here on Yelp - I had to toss in my two cents. 

I've been here three times and I can tell you without hesitation: I will never be back. Indifferent service and mediocre food make this a choice location for unsuspecting out-of-towners searching for a burger or salad in the heart of the Pearl.

I'm not sure why the food is uninspired. The location is great and there is some outdoor dining opportunities and decent people-watching but whatever the reason, Manzana doesn't work. This is part of the same group that owns Stanfords, Newport and Henry's up the street. Regardless, do stay away. Really, it's not good.",1
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it aptly titled ""Happy Hour"" for a reason? Namely, when a bar declares it is now ""Happy Hour"" aren't discounted alcoholic beverages in order?

Gotta say I was slightly peeved that at Manzana the term only refers to half off appetizers and not cocktails. I had to fork over $8 for a Mango Mojito, which was not what I had in mind in the slightest. 

Granted, it was a terrific drink so at least my $8 was not spent in vain. However my guard is now up and I won't be quick to jump for joy whenever I hear about a place having a ""Happy Hour"" without further investigating whether it refers to their alcohol menu - which is what would really make me happy.",2
"I'm not sure why I'm even bothering to write a review for this place. You know what to expect. Either you like it or you don't. 

That said, the place was just so dirty, like every surface needed to be scrubbed. (Not to sound superficial but) the women weren't very attractive. The orange neon lighting gave me a migraine and made me feel like I was in a toaster.  Or Kramer's apartment when the Kenny Rogers' Roaster was across the street.  And, worst of all, you get a beer at the bar and they don't factor the tax into drink prices.  So a beer will cost you, like $3.67. Always annoying.",1
"today i shall review hooters.

with a name like titguy, one would think i would like this place.  i was very TITSappointed.  

in my mind, the whole premise of hooters is to have attractive, big tittied waitresses in orange hot pants.  in my experience here, i only saw orange hot pants.  the waitresses did have tits, but they were not of mammoth porportions one would expect from a restaurant named hooters.  not that the waitresses were ugly, but i've seen better looking ones in 80% of the restaurants i go to.  especially with the pool of talent in a young college town like boston, you would think boobs and ass would be flying around like their wings in this place.  

i thought it might have been an off day talent wise so i even went back a few more times thinking i would strike gold.  all i found was a bar of lead.  i've only been to 2 other hooters (CA and FL)  and this is by far the worst one.  the one in florida (miami?) was by far the best.  the service there was quick and the waitresses genuinely seemed friendly.  oh yeah, they're 4x more attractive as well.  it must be a southern thing.  people in the northeast always seem a bit distant.

prices are average at best.  

they do show some ppv events here.  when they show wrestling, it's almost like you're at a live event if you're into that type of thing.

the thing i like best about this place is the name of the street.  friend st!  you can't get any better than friend st!",2
"This place just sucks.  When you go 0-3 during restaurant week that is pretty bad.

Appetizer - Corn and Tomato gazpacho   There was NO corn in it.  Basically, the description on the menu was nothing like what was brought to me.  It was pretty good, but it was not what was on the menu

Dinner - Tenderloin.  I asked for medium rare and it came out completely cooked.  Instead of a nice hot, juicy tenderloin, it was a grey chewy piece of steak.

Desert - Mud Pie  Yeah, not a mud pie, but a cold, hard brownie.

My wife works right around the corner from here so it would be convenient for us, but we will not be going back",2
"Laurel was by far the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. Service was terrible and food was less than mediocre. I had to send back my pork tenderloin because it was raw. When it came back, it was still raw. The appetizers were so small we couldn't share...thank god we all got our own. I was 100% dissatisfied and i do not reccomend this restaurant.",1
"I've gone here once before restaurant week and it was just alright, but the first Sunday of the 2010 spring restaurant week was weak (haha) and unimpressive.

Lobster bisque was more like pureed squash with a few chunks of meat. The tenderloin portion was enormous, but the sauce and filling lacked some serious flavor. The only success was dessert, and how can you mess up a brownie?

The only saving grace was the waitress, who was cordial and warm, offering us a great backup wine when the one we chose was out of stock. Overall, I doubt I'll come back.",1
"Severely disappointed.

I came here recently with a large party (about 12 of us) for a friend's birthday--Yelper Tori G.

I'll start with the good:
1 Star for pretty tasty drinks, although the mixed drink I had tasted rather weak.
1 Star for delicious food. I ordered a special entree--a spinach and mozzarella ravioli with chicken and sun dried tomatoes that I happily inhaled.

The bad:

We had reservations for 8:30. The first members of our party arrived early and sat at the bar awaiting our arrival. The rest of us showed up at or a little after 8:30 and joined the group for drinks as we waited for our table.

FORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER we were seated after another large party finally left. I understand that restaurants can't always compensate for instances like this, but their lack of acknowledgment  of the mishap was extremely unprofessional.

The staff didn't even keep us to date on the status of our table, but instead left us waiting. There was no apology (neither verbal nor tangible) from anyone either. If you're running behind, simple updates on the situation are expected. A free drink, dessert, or anything else isn't necessary, but appreciated as an acknowledgment to your mistake.

The service was adequate, but not friendly. I felt our waitress was more robotic in her tasks than personable in her service.

And the decor? Ugh. I felt like it was unsure of itself. The bar area seemed a bit colonial and charming. While the dining room area tried to be more modern. In the end, I felt like i was in a Howard Johnson lobby eating my complimentary breakfast.

The food is great. But let's match the atmosphere and service to that and I will surely give you at least 4 stars.

Oh, and I found it comical that they didn't forget to add the automatic gratuity to the bill. I guess for large parties, you always have to pay the undeserved tips.",2
"There was a time when I would have given Laurel a 5, but I feel like they've slipped over time.  While the restaurant is still reasonably priced, it's not as frugal as it used to be (though, I get it - you've got to turn a profit).  The problem for me is that, over time, the prices have gone up while the food quality and cleanliness/upkeep of the space has slipped.

If you go during the day, you especially notice it, but either way you can see that the place just needs some TLC.  A lot of the chairs are rickety, the carpet is stained, the walls have scrapes and dirt and need a fresh coat of paint, the menus are often just worn and dirty.  It just feels like the place needs to be sterilized and have some basic repairs done.

The food is hit or miss.  When everything was $10.00, it was ok.  But, now at often $20.00 or more a plate, it shouldn't be.  

NOTE:  I would have given this three stars, because to me 2 does seem a little harsh - but I'm trying to stick with Yelp's guidance and 3 stars is ""A-OK"" and I don't think it is A-OK.  So, I went with 2 (the ""Meh. I've experienced better"" option.",2
"I was disappointed after coming here for a celebration. The room certainly looks very nice and the service was fine- but the food was fall below expectations. The rare tuna appetizer was tasteless. Bland, dry chicken entree. My pasta (a special that night) tasted like it came from the Lipton PastaRoni box! Will not head back here anytime soon.",1
"My dinner group ate there recently and there were mixed reviews on the food and service, but all agreed on the horrible truth that Tim's steak dinner ""was overcooked ... twice"" and ""chefs should be flogged in public for overcooking good beef."" Making matters worse ""nothing was comped"" for the error(s). ""As with their other restaurant, 5 Burner (a former FF with the worst scores EVER) this place just doesn't live up to its potential.""

I had the jambalaya special, which was well spiced, but all the fish was overcooked and rubbery.  It's what i'm used to at Laural, and what the above reviews bear out - nothing here is ever inedible, but it's never very good either. 

Laurel used to do ""everything $10 pricing"" back a few years ago, and back then the food WAS either better, or seemed better because it was cheap.. But for the current level of food, there is MUCH better food to be had at the same price point. (Try Coda around the corner and down the street on Columbus instead.)

And a note about the overdone steak.  Fine, kitchen's screw up sometimes. First of all, the waitress had to be flagged down to be asked to have the streak redone (I saw it - the ""medium rare"" was uniformly grey - at best medium well.) So she politely said she'd have it redone. And then brought back a SMALLER steak cooked to about the same doneness.

She had the diner cut it, check it, and could see that it was underdone.  When he hesitatingly replied ""eh... it's fine"" in an obviously ""it's really not fine, but i'm sick of dealing with you"" tone, she happily said ""OK great"" and left.

The dinner was organized by someone else, so I did'nt feel i could jump in and ask for somethig comped (they weren't going to comp the most expensive thing on the menu, but they should have comped SOMETHING.)  You shoudn't have to ask, because they knew they screwed up.

It just shows an overall sloppiness and disregard for the customers, that's even more in evidence at 6 Burner.  Seriously, Laural really doesn't deserve to survive on this level of service and food quality.",2
"Not the best dining experience, but not the worst either. Certainly a nice atmosphere, good menu selections, genial staff.  But, the meals were fair, it's quality the same, and the dishes were not that well prepared. 

It's fine for a casual dinner or nice meet-up spot. I tried the risotto with spinach and artichoke - um, well.... it was good enough to eat, but the spinach was stringy and the chunks of artichoke were not properly prepped. There were inconsistent sizes of chunks and artichoke scraps all tossed in to the dish. The whole plate seemed like a bit of an afterthought... I imagine the cooks (not chefs) saying ""we've got good risotto, now what can we add to it?"" 

My partner had the burger... well it was a pricey.. um burger. Fries lacked anything special, the brie tasteless and the bacon burned!

There was nothing to ""ooh"" or ""ahh"" about here.

The value for the area and atmosphere are ok if you get the prix fix menu. 

If you're a foodie, keep looking!",1
"I went there for valentines day. It started off bad because the address on Yelp was wrong and we spent half an hour in the cold boston wind looking for this place. The staff on the phone were very patient and helpful. When we got there we were expecting some really delicious comfort food judging from the reviews. The appetizer met our expectations well (lobster macaroni). But the main course was another story. We got the valentines day pre-fix since that seemed to be the only thing available. No prices for the pre-fix? no prices for the cocktails? oh well, how much could it possibly be.... before i get into that, the food was very very disappointing. I ordered honey glazed chicken and my chicken was so dry you could see how dry it was and hear how dry it was when you chewed. My boyfriend ordered swordfish and he was begging me to trade my chicken for it. The dessert was mediocre... When the check came, it was over $125. To give you an idea of how bad of a deal that is, the next night we went to Atlantic Fish with one other person and i was stuffed with fresh scallops, clam chowder and extra extra dessert (which tasted heavenly)... the check came out to be LESS and the dinner at Laurel, we had ONE MORE PERSON, and the food was WAY better.",1
"I'm just really missing the boat on this one. The BF and I tried Laurel for the first time, and I must say, there is just so much better out there at that price point. The menu sounded absolutely fantastic but that's where it ended. Every single thing we ordered from start to finish was incredibly bland. There was nothing fresh and or flavorable on our plates at any time.

We started with a couple of drinks at the bar. If you are a wine or beer lover, this is NOT the place for you, as both lists are truly uninspired and really more appropriate for a chain restaurant. But the bar and restaurant space are really cute.

On to dinner. I must say, our waitress was excellent. Friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. I wish I could rave about the food too, but it was just so lackluster. We started with the fried calamari and tequila lime shrimp cocktail. The shrimp was positively tasteless. Not a hint of tequila or lime, not even a hint of, well, shrimp. It came in a glass with salsa fresca and angel hair pasta, which was actually more enjoyable than the shrimp. On the other hand, the calamari was extremely flavorful - that is, if you don't like the taste of calamari but adore salt. It was rings and no legs, which is a huge bummer for me, but that's just a personal preference.

I had the lobster risotto and my BF had the marinated flank steak. The risotto was bland but OK, though it was a lot more like rice than risotto. The BF's steak was very weak. Bland and very overcooked (he asked for rare and received medium). The french fries were just sad. The meal came with steak sauce on the side, which he would normally have scoffed at but he tried it out of desperation for a little flavor. It was - you guessed it - tasteless! 

I'm really perplexed by the high reviews for this place. If you really want to save a bit of money in the Back Bay but also want food that tastes like something, go down the street to Parish Cafe or even Cottonwood just a block away. Similar price points, significantly better food. Or better yet, go a T stop or two and hit Marliave or Silvertone.",2
"Laurel may well serve quality food to many happy diners. But my dining buddy and I agreed, Laurel is not worth the savings. We came in just before 7pm on what our waitress said was a typically busy Saturday night. We had drinks and then ordered the grilled eggplant, polenta and mozzarella entree and shared it as a starter.
The eggplant was just not cooked correctly, it had grill marks to indicate an effort was made to make it appear cooked, but it was underdone, chewy, sliced too thickly and borderline inedible. This is the reason why so many people think they dislike eggplant. The mozz was cold. I don't mean not hot, I mean cold, as in the chef decided it should be served that way. It was odd considering the rest of the dish was warm. The tomato sauce seemed as though it could have come from a jar. Overall or $15 the dish disappoints. 

We then opted for the special, a sort of kitchen sink stuffed sole ($21) with keilbasa, tomato, broccoli, mussels and clams in a white wine broth. The sole was slightly overcooked and despite all accoutrements, lacked flavor. The crab stuffing was a bit fishy and also bland. The dish didn't seem to have been conceived for any reason, other than perhaps that the chef had some keilbasa on hand. 

Service was attentive at first, when all we wanted was to enjoy our drinks, then intermittent when we actually required some attention. We are not needy diners. But we do appreciate the occasional water refill.

Overall Laurel definitely has better prices then most spots in the neighborhood, but for us, it was not worth the savings. Maybe the restaurant excels in their meat dishes, but I am not willing to spend the money to find out.",1
"Meh.  

The food... Meh
The service... Meh-ier
The wine... $5 bottle for $18.  MEH! 

Well, some friends and I tried this place on Saturday night and decided then that we won't be back.  Oh well.  My salmon wasn't too bad but a couple of my friends got the stuffed pork loin and the stuffing, I SWEAR TO GOD, was maple brown sugar cream of wheat.  Same texture, same flavor.  Maybe it's a well kept secret of the culinary world, but... uhh... no.  Oh and the potatoes that came with my salmon were practically raw.  Ewww... 

I have to say the entertainment was amazing.  And by entertainment i mean the table next to us FULL, and i mean about 7 or 8 transvestites ... or transsexuals (trust me, it was really hard to tell based on their conversation) next to us.  PURE ENJOYMENT. Some of 'em looked pretty FIERCE too.  Then, not as entertaining but fun to listen to, was a table of middle-aged gay men at a birthday celebration.  Alls I can say is that I hope I'm that feisty when I'm 50-something.",2
"We loved the ambience. Our waitress however was ...an alcoholic. I swear. party girl. She forgot my wine 3 times. 
 Hubby had the Lobster Bisque which was quite good. I had something that I can't remember what it was except it didn't have much flair or flavor. Maybe that is why I can't remember it. OR, maybe I had 3 glasses of wine (no, I didn't....)
I don't know what to really say about this place except I might try it again, it was just lacking the night we went.",2
"I wouldn't even give this a place one star if I had the option. Who charges for jam? Nothing worst than cheap greedy people that don't provide service and look for every opportunity to stick it to you. I was surprised the water was free. Last time I'll ever come here. The little things matter and this place or management doesn't get it. Sausages were raw, so disgusting",1
"Only found out about this place last month, after working in the area for 6+ years

Since my usual lunch spot was closed today, i decided to give this place a try. 

BAAAAD mistake. food was/is disgusting

I ordered a wonton soup and their Donkatz dinner (japanese fried pork cutlet on rice)

Their wontons must have been sitting in the soup for a week. The wonton wrappers were all falling off due to sogginess. The filling inside is a plain pork meatball seasoned with maybe a touch of salt. (picture boiling ground pork and eating is like that. just horrible)

Next, the  pork cutlet on rice. The rice was so soft and sticky, it was more like white diarrhea plopped in my take out container with a 1/8 inch overfried piece of breaded pork laying on top and slathered in some weird bbq sauce that probably consists of whatever leftover sauces they had sitting there. 

Don't even both trying this place. save your money. you're better off eating gas station butter chicken.",1
you'd be much better off heading to chinatown than to wisteria. it's pretty americanized chinese food... nothing special to speak of. the boba (pearl milk tea) is much better in the hong kong eatery than here... i'd say it's somewhat unremarkable chinese food. prices aren't too bad.,2
I used to work in a place that had access to their back alley.  One word: rats.  They kept their food out in the back a little too long at times.  maybe they cleaned up their act by now (please feel free to correct me) but...SCARY!,1
"Horrific! The  place itself smells like the scented detergent I use to wash off stains and on the floors in my trailer! The chicken is horrible, the rice is horrible, and there is no steamed veggies!! HORRIBLE!!!!",1
"Seriously, I've been wanting to try this place because of the review. Yuk. Can't shake my head enough to get the taste out off my mouth. Don't get me wrong. They make a great cheap drink, and don't forget the poker, but this definitely is not a restaurant. 
 My mistake was thinking the Asian gentleman mig
ht be able to pull off a simple teriyaki bowl. NOT . I've had  better at 7.11. Don't bother even coming here for a drink. Your better off stopping at the liquor store. I'm surprised he stays in business.",1
"Tasteless food, if offered, usually you have to wake up the person behind the counter, dirty, and if you play video poker it will be in an hot airless room and do NOT expect free water or anything else.",1
"Not good.  Tasteless, over cooked chicken, and rice that was probably cooked a few hours ago.  The vegetables were steamed but not salted or seasoned at all.  Sticky tables and the place smells like a laundromat.  Maybe ok if you just need your belly filled, other than that I would stay away!",1
"Bad food! Bad service! Been there 3x and it's a strike!
They charge for hot sauce. I ordered their ice-cream mochi dessert one time and I swear it was out of the packages of a box that you can buy from T&T. Even found a wire in my tempura! Can't believe they still wanted to charge me for the dish!",1
"We ordered a salmon and tuna combo, a vegetable udon, and a few pieces of nigiri sushi. The service was minimal to the point of almost being bad. Our server (and the chefs) were too busy chit-chatting and watching TV. When the food was finally served - almost 20 minutes which seemed forever compared to our other usual sushi places - we were somewhat disappointed at the mediocre appearance and small portions. When we tasted the food, we decided that was first visit is likely our last. The other sushi places within 2-3 blocks away are far better in quality even if a bit more expensive.",1
Awful portions. Got 3 pieces of meat with my noodles. Food was dry tasted awful. Never going back.,1
"I have a wheat allergy and when my server asked me for my order I informed her of my allergy and asked her what was available. She told me that they do not use wheat in ANY of their dishes. I asked about the crab rangoon, the dumplings and the breaded chicken. NO WHEAT, do you want? she stated. I walked away without purchasing any food, and checked their website later and it states clearly that they offer no gluten free food. I was upset that they had no concern over their customers well being.",1
"That was the worst meals I've had in years. First, I ordered the caldo de pollo but I was told it would take 30 minutes so I got the caldo de camarones instead. That was overcooked shrimp with poop streaks in dirty dishwater and a shallow spoon. My friend ordered the beef stew and was told it would take an hour so he got the snapper soup instead and I was sickened at the sight and smell of it.",1
"While the food here is delicious and authentic, bad attitudes from the staff can be a complete turn off. Today we ordered 4 pupusas and 2 tamales to go and called at 11am, an hour after they've been open, and was told 15 min wait. We get there at 11:15am and they say they are working on it and we also went ahead and paid for the food. We asked around 11:25 how much longer and they said they were still working on it with attitudes and when they finally gave us our order, it wasnt until then that we got our change we were due which isn't right. We didn't walk out of there until 11:38am. I don't know if or when we will be back

10/14
DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE IF YOU DONT WANT TO WAIT 45 MINUTES FOR 4 PUPUSAS. I ORDERED 4 PUPUSAS TO GO AT 10:40AM TODAY AND I GOT THERE AT 11:20AM AND WAITED FIVE MORE MINUTES AND WALKED OUT. RIDICULOUS. I THOUGHT ORDERING AHEAD OF TIME THAT WHEN I HAD PLANNED TO BE NEAR THERE WOULD HELP. IT DIDNT.",1
"One of the WORST restaurants I've ever been. 
They took about 40 minutes to bring my food and the place was basically EMPY. How's that possible ? The food was terrible and cold. And the waitress took about 20 minutes JUST TO BRING ME MY CHANGE!! $5!!!
Absolutely Terrible",1
"Jun 30 
We came to have dinner  but  was very hot 
We tell the server she said , she let the owner know or manager know but still same we decide to take it Togo , i will not recomend this place at all, ... 
We wait to a lot  for them to take are order !",1
"what is this place?
a doctors office?
are we seriously drinking
in the waiting room 
of a doctors office?
no thanks.
next!",2
"Flavor is good and all but when I ordered a steak tip and they substitute a portion of it with chicken and I had to pay full price without them letting me know that during a long and tiring day... yeah that's a real bummer, not only that but I even watched the lady in front of me at the register kill a cockroach with her notepad, yeah..... not coming back anytime soon, it was nice while it lasted....",1
"A below average lunch location in the city of sin.  The food is of supermarket freezer section quality.  If you must have fast food due to time constraints, are in the area and are tired of the other options like McDonalds or KFC it is an alternative.  But not a pleasant one.",1
"So tbh I was working on a badge for yelp, and this one was a cheat. It was obvious that people were trolling the place, rating it $$$$ (über expensive) which got me the high roller badge.

But there was a price to pay.

The reviews said that this place served garbage. I thought this was yet another exagerration, just whiney, entitled, arrogant yuppies complaining about a location. Except, a lot of people were saying this.

Entering the shop I note it is clean, and it's obvious there's an identity crisis as there is a display with (fresh?) baked breads, and menu for a standard take out roast beef and seafood shop with some hispanic options as well. I was willing to give this place a shot, I have found many diamonds in the rough where others have walked by not noticing the treasure. Except this would be fools gold which I would find.

Lady working the shop (cashier/cook) was friendly enough. The shop was clean. A sign for A rated health inspection on the front window. What could go wrong?

A lot.

I ordered something simple and quick, which should have been delicious. The roast beef was horrible. It was grey and dry, cooked way past it's prime. I think this place is sooo not-busy, that they are saving the roasts for days at a time and continually reheat/slice, making this a culinary abortion of a classic North Shore delicacy. The onion roll was oviously old as it was dry and the crust was crumbling off.

Not to be wasteful, I did what I had been taught as a child and finished my meal. There was something not right, there was a tang to it and I'm sure it wasn't from the sauce and cheese I ordered for the sandwich.

Cut scene from me on my couch deciding if this is all a huge mistake, to me at work standing over the toilet... vomiting. Yes I had an upset stomach, started breaking out into a sweat, while my stomach did back flips.

I will usually give 2 stars  if food is bad but service is good. But this is really bad, like I felt sick after eating the food. This is not okay, and this restaurant should be avoided. This is not the people's choice.",1
"We went here at my sisters suggestion as it was great way back when (she moved out of the area over a decade ago). Apparently this place has seriously changed. New management or whatever.

The place was dead when we went in. It looked clean enough in the front, but couldnt see in back. The staff barely spoke a lick of english.

seeing as it was advertised as a roast beef place, i ordered a roast beef plate. through body language, rather than english, they communicated that they were out of roast beef. .. ok.. well i really wanted roast beef, so i just went across the street to House of Roast Beef to get mine, which was apparently a wise choice.

They ordered about 6 cheeseburger subs. just subs, nothing special. It took them well over a half an hour to make the subs. and it turned out that all 6 were utter garbage. made from frozen beef, tough, poorly cooked, poorly assembled, bad tasting. just gross. they also ordered jalapeno poppers, but, surprise, they were out of those too.

I don't even know how this place does any business. if you are looking for a sub in the area, do yourself a favor and just go across the street. you'll have a much better experience.",1
"The food is really hit or miss. Sometimes it is phenomenal and other times very bad.  This is why I've stopped going. The cheeseburgers are consistently awesome, though.",2
I was starving so thought I'd take the chance on this place. All I can say is I should have listened to my mom on the phone when she said I should leave BC there was a whole Spanish family in the back where the food was prepped and cooked literally I mean the grandma and like 3-4 kids under 12 one teenager so I got the food Nd took one bite and threw up,1
Low quality food at high prices. Really bad even by airport standards! OK If you only want a beer. In concourse B.,1
"You gotta really be starving between flights to like this fare. Crowded, blah food, and average service. What's to like?",2
"Possibly the worst buffalo wings I have ever had.  The beer is good though.  The menu said 8 large wings, I had the tiniest wings saturated with God awful buffalo sauce.  $8.95 so basically a little over a dollar a piece.  Nathan's hot dog across the hall would have been a better choice for me.",1
"DON'T EAT AT THE COACHES CORNER!!! I sat at this dirty dump for 15 min with servers walking around me never making eye contact once. I did everything i could to get their attention except snapping, yelling or all of the other rude things servers put up with. So, I wasn't able to try their...from what I read 'average' food.  Now I'm at Friday's with a very pleasant server and the food is already here.",1
"Had an hour layover in ATL and needed breakfast. This restaurant wasn't even a quarter full so we walked in and were seated and then forgotten. We sat there for about 10 minutes waiting on someone to come over when a couple was seated right next to us. As we sat there, we watched them get drinks, and have their order taken while we still hadn't been spoken to. All this while 5 employees stood on the wall talking....we got up and walked out. Someone missed out on a good tip...",1
"Look, I knew this was my only quick, cheap, non fast food option, so my expectations were low.  Service was quick.  I just played it safe, as you should at a cheap, off-brand bar, at an airport.  Although you CAN screw up nachos, it's safe.  These were not top-notch nachos by any means, but they did the trick.",2
Bleck!  For a fast food burger that costs $10.50 I hoped for decent quality meat.  But what they serve is that gross tasting filler stuff trying to pass itself off as beef that's all too common at fairs or your company picnic.,1
This place was busy so I figured it should be good..... That's what u get for assuming. The food came quick which is a huge plus! The fries were ok but the grilled chicken sandwich was tasteless and chewy. The waitress was so distracted she gave my credit card to another table and never even noticed!!! I wouldn't recommend this place but if you do stop in be sure to use cash!!,1
I sooo wanted to give this place 5 stars because the cheesy fries were uhmazeballs BUT turns out their food gave me food poisoning. Both my boyfriend and I ate from here and it made us sick from both ends. Plus they had a little girl just running around in the back where the kitchen is. Eat here at your own risk!,1
"Man I feel so bad giving this place a horrible review, because I actually DO enjoy their food. It isn't amazing but it is for sure tasty. I guess my review is more about the establishment itself.....and the ANTS.

My boyfriend and I ate at Charley's over the summer while I was on lunch break, and I had been craving a tasty, cheesey sub for awhile. And the food was, as usual, good, but there were ants EVERYWHERE. 

I didn't notice it at first, and ate almost my entire meal before I looked over [and i'm inside, mind you] and saw a line of ants crawling all over the walls and floor. There were thousands of them. It was the most disgusting thing I had ever seen. 

The place always seemed pretty dingey inside, and the workers are less than upstanding. I'm going to assume this is just a case of negligence and lack of people caring about the establishment. But it's sad. I can never ever ever eat there again.

Hope it doesn't go for all locations, and maybe it was a one-day thing. But if your place is dirty enough that ants have made a home there, then you're doing something wrong.",1
"If you like eating in giant protein-powder retail storefront, this is the place for you. Most menu items I've tried are pretty gross, but the Texicali Turkey sandwich is decent sans pickles. You don't get a lot of food for the money, and might be hungry a few hours later. Also, I'm not sure why you can't get a freshly brewed iced-tea if the goal here is being healthy. They have fountain Pepsi products and some sweetened bottled teas. I'd recommend it if you are tired of eating at Fresh City and want to be a little healthier than Quiznos.",2
"this is in the building I work. this place is like a giant george foreman grill. I got a chicken meatball ""burro"", thinking it would be something along the lines of say, a chicken burrito. it was tasty in the same way eating a can of spaghettios when you're really hungry is good.

but it wasn't! it was like a meatball sub, disgustingly processed chicken made into meatballs covered in nasty marinara sauce, enclosed in a flimsy tortilla with rice. there were no vegetables in the burro, it was just rice, sauce and disgusting chicken meatballs. and it cost me $6.50. 

i've only been here once, and i would only go again out of desperation.",1
"Never been in this place before, so I decided to stop by- No joke, this is the nastiest looking restaurant I've ever seen.

It's more like a pig trough for human beings. The floor hasn't been swept or even mopped in months. Evidently, they're paying off the health department. There is no possible way this business could ever pass any type of health inspection.

If you don't believe everything I've mentioned here, check it out for yourself. Wish I could give them zero stars. This place is nasty and they should be ashamed to call themselves a ""restaurant.""",1
"Probably should have checked Yelp before heading out.  Little hole in the wall just west of town, but definitely closed on Sunday at 2pm.  I guess they don't need the dinner business . .",1
"Food is ok, but the man who grill is rude and a bully to his coworker. Never go back there again because their food aren't  that great.",1
"She points to the cash only sign at the register,   no signage in the ordering area.... Bastards!

Who the heck doesn't take plastic...  Never again umi.",1
So I haven't been to the food court at the mall in a long long time.   Maybe I should've stayed away.  As I was walking around the standard is to hand you a sample on a toothpick from a lot of the Asian spots.  So I passed Umi.  There was a nice fresh hot piece of chicken on the end of the toothpick I continued my journey around the food court and decided I'll get Umi Chicken on rice.  Needless to say that one little leader piece of chicken tasted nothing like the plate of chicken I received. My chicken was dry no flavor totally opposite of the piece of chicken on the toothpick.  Well I think it'll be another long long long time before I enter a mall food court again there are so many other nice choices at the mall.  I am sorry I even spent my eight or nine dollars definitely not worth it.  My advice stay away!!,2
"I must say my experience here today has forever left a bad impression on me. I will not be coming here again for numerous reasons.

1. It took them 25 minutes to cook me an order of their chicken teriyaki plate. That's an absurd amount of time to cook it.. especially when it wasn't that busy and I was told it would only take a few minutes.

2. They put WAYYY to much sauce on it. The rice was drenched in the sauce and it took away the tastes of everything because it was so overpowering. I'm not even kidding when I say it was like eating soup instead of a rice plate.. that's how much sauce they put on it.

3. When they're cooking more than one serving, they cook numerous orders together. In my case.. four orders were being cooked simultaneously with all the meats and vegetables being mixed together for four separate orders. This does not work because all the orders were not portioned correctly.

So when he started to put the stir fry on the rice plates.. some got more meat than others. In my case, I got way less meat than I thought I would and I only found out after getting home. If I'm paying over 7 dollars for a plate of food.. I expect a lot more meat than what I was actually served. I would've been better off just ordering from the already prepared sections. That was the biggest issue I had with this instance.

I like the food, I really do but this experience really soured my views on this establishment and I won't be coming here again bc of it.",1
"So today I got a "" 2 meat and chicken rice"" ""2 meat"" is $6.89 + ""chicken rice"" $0.60 = $7.49 plus 6.25% ($0.47) Tax = $7.96 but on my receipt is says ($0.52) for tax and the total comes to $8.01. I don't know why it turn out like this but I'm this place and the one at Northshore Mall is making a fortune out of it. I can't believe it. I even gave them a $20 bill and they gave me back $11.99 instead of $12.........",1
Been there twice and both times they shut the grill down early for the only good thing they have Teriyaki Chicken. Oct 23rd 7:50pm when the mall closes at 9pm I was told no more Teriyaki chicken. When there was 2 orders of teriyaki chicken cooking on the grill as I stood there while they were cleaning. They didn't  seem to care they were losing my business when I walked away but that's the last time I go there.,1
"If I could give ZERO STARS, I would! man at grill is extremely rude and has very bad English communication skills. Food is gross. Chicken is all fat and the mixed veggies is all bean sprouts and if you are lucky, you might get 1 mushroom!
That was MY FIRST AND LAST TIME THERE! FOOD and SERVICE SUCK!!",1
"Here's the thing, Chronis': do you want to make money? Are you making good money right now? Or has your profit margin slowly declined? Have you blamed it on the economy?? Because, I love this bar and don't want to see it fail and honey! Its not the economy. Friday and Saturday nights; Birdie is the best thing. The bartender is always a peach! I love karaoke, and whoever that other lady is is fine with me! But my dear, sweet Chronis... you need young people to want to come to you bar and stay! My top four suggestions:
1. Stop kicking people out at 1:45pm. Stop cleaning up at 1. If you are open till 2:15, you are open till 2:15. I know the four of you want to go home. But this is the hospitality business... don't rush folks out the door. Get some staff willing to be and stay energetic until after the last guest leaves. They pay your bills! Why are you so annoyed?
2. The florecent lights. I know, I know they are cheap. They look cheap too. And you can see how absolutely filthy everything is. Get some lower lighting in the front area. Which reminds me... when is the last time someone really cleaned the grease trap? Get someone out to do it. Take out the carpet if you can. It will be worth the investment and allow you to compete with your neighboring bars.
3. Serve food. Willingly. Have a nighttime menu with something besides cold sandwiches. Better yet! Stay open after 2:15 to serve the crowds exiting the bars. No one else does; corner the market. And I know the guy in the flanel shirts is probably a sweet pea but why does he stand there and stare at customers all night? Home come he can have pizza right in front of me and I can't? Why the dirty looks? Forever with the suspicious looks! 

Best of luck!

"Yikes!  I feel cheated into trying this bar out.  After seeing a good review and peeked curiosity, I popped in with a friend to give this place a try.

To be completely honest, I did not order anything only because the place had an absolutely awful smell.  It smelt like mildew and death. I know it's not fair to review without sampling first, but after waiting around for service and feeling nauseous, had to bail.

It may have been a bad smelly night for the business the night I was there, so you don't have to take my word for it, but enter at your own risk.",1
My husband and I walked in for just one drink before we went back across the river to Oregon. We sat at the bar for 25 minutes and were ignored completely and not acknowledged at all. I'm not sure if it's because we are not locals or whatever the reason. Not coming back here but lots of compliments to the bar Dublin Down around the corner with friendly bartenders and great service!!,1
This place was extremely understaffed could not handle a birthday party the bartender was rude she would not serve us the best thing about this bar is that they are next door to a great pub with great service called the Dublin Down,1
"I don't get it.  I've been here 3 times, all for dinner.  The food never quite does it and in some cases, has been awful.  The waitstaff (I've been on both weekday and weekend nights) is not attentive and it's hard to get a second glass of wine or a cocktail.

Last time I left, I swore I'd never go back.",1
"I think the food here is yummy and the wine selection is super.  The comfortable and cozy atmosphere are also fantastic experience.  But, alas, as much as it pains me, I must somberly give Cafe D only two stars.  While Cafe D is in every way poised for splendid greatness, the wretched, festering appendage that is the SERVICE at Cafe D holds back this fine restaurant from the glory that is so close within reach.  Seriously.  This is not some bitter rant after one night of bad service.  I have visited Cafe D and every time and it is always the same thing.  Slow, inattentive, detached and lazy service.  I don't need to go into detail here, it's your pretty standard stuff.  Wait ten minutes to first see the server, never see them again after the food comes, never get offered a second drink let alone a water refill, etc.  Suffice to say, it's the basic stuff.  Still, I always come back, hoping it will be better.  I've forgiven you Cafe D.  I've told myself that it's not your fault.  Whenever I walk by I hear you gently saying, ""Come on baby, it'll never happen again, I promise.""  But no, it never changes.  Ever.  Service is all important and it is part of the reason that people go out to eat.  Service can absolutely kill and otherwise great place.  And Cafe D, it's killing you...ever so slowly...one customer at a time...",2
Tried soups there couple of times - not tasty. They tend to put ingredients that are not prescribed by general recipe.,2
"Atmosphere: terrific

Service: fine, save for the fact that our waitress barely spoke to us, and didn't mention the specials (we overheard them being told to another table, AFTER we'd ordered). 

Food: Below average. Everything was bland, bland, bland. We had a shrimp & toasted ravioli appetizer, it was so blah. No taste whatsoever, and the shrimp were not fresh. Caesar salad was also tasteless. The dressing had nothing to it. Entrees were a swordfish steak that was overcooked, and potato gnocchi in a marinara sauce w/ baby shrimp. The swordfish came w/ mashed potatoes and sauteed vegetables, all of which were less than acceptable. The gnocchi was overcooked and gummy, and the ""baby shrimp"" were straight out of a can. 

The prices here are astronomical, for what you get. We left here, and headed straight for Legal's, next door, for some steamers, as neither of us could finish our meals. We may only go back for the piano bar, but will not be back for dinner. We've learned our lesson on this one.",1
"HATED IT.

I'm a HUGE, HUGE, HUGE Sinatra fan.

He, would NOT approve.

The place is nicely decorated, but the cold and snooty service and completely underwhelming food left us ashamed to be here.

Our waiter was virtually non-existent, and we're talking maybe 2 other couples in the entire place.  

There was some kind of ""special"" corner seating arrangement, where we would have LIKED to be - since the place was dead - but no, they sat us smack dab in the middle of the place.  It was awkward.  Like being in a fishbowl.  Music was too quiet - which I NEVER say - but here I WANT to hear Frank and Dean in the background.

I think the owner and his best pal were chatting at the bar instead of, dare I say, WORK.  

I hated it here and I am NEVER going back.",1
"My first two outings to the Rat Pack were great, but I had not been for 3 years or more. The food was always great. The service was attentive. And the ambiance was really cool.

But my recent experience just last week was really sub par on all counts. 

It was Valentines day and we had a 9pm reservation. We arrived at 8:40 and the place was very quite with lots of open tables (not a good sign, the word may be out). The hostess seems perplexed that we arrived so early (""Gee, is it 9pm already?"") and then went on to say ""hmm, I'll see if I can seat you soon."".

You mean at 1 of the 6 open tables perhaps? :)

The waitress was pleasant but we heard her apologize to a few tables for something. For us, she brought the wrong bottle of wine.
But the service was fine. I'm not that picky.

But the food is the real story. My wife and I agreed that it was really bad. Almost tasteless.

I had the scallops lobster ravioli. They tasted about the same...nothing there.

My wife had the chicken and thought it was pub quality.

Too bad. There are not many options for good food in metro-west and now there is one less if you ask me. For us, we do not get out enough to waste a night out on the Rat Pack again. We won't be back.",2
THIS RESTAURANT HAS CLOSED.  It is now the site of the Bollywood Grill.,1
"If I could give this place less than 1 star I would.  I went here because I'm a new Quincy resident looking for a great breakfast spot  and this is definitely not it.  First of all, when my boyfriend and I arrived we were not acknowledged let alone greeted (by the way he 6'5 so pretty hard to miss).  Another customer told us that we could seat ourselves after 5 minutes of standing bewilderment - so we did.  I had to then ask the guy behind me after 10 minutes of additional bewilderment if I also had to get my own menu because another couple facing the same issues we were got their own menus and no one had greeted them either.  They left after a few more minutes of being ignored and we should have too.  
 
Finally, our server comes and is really sweet but not good at all.  Our food was average and the scones sucked.  The Irish bread was OK but my boyfriend enjoyed the bangers a lot.  

However, the bangers are not good enough to get us back at Mannion's ever again.  Don't waste your time or money at this place.  

Since then we opted to stick w/what we know like McKenna's in Savin Hill - where the foods phenomenal and the service is always worth the wait - but don't forget to write your name in the book when you walk in.",1
"This location often has terrible customer service. For some reason they like putting the most unfriendly people at the window, who blame you when THEY mess your order up. The district manager of this location is also no help and likes to push things under the rug. There have been a few nice employees, but overall, I wouldn't recommend this location. I literally work 1 minute from this location and have felt the need to go way out of my way to another location, just to avoid some of this location.",1
"I go here nearly every morning. Recently I get a double shot of espresso.  This morning  I get  charged 5.09 for that and a chocolate dip donut.  When I ask how much the double shot espresso was the girl tells me 4.05 .  I said no it's 2.05, she tells me the price must have gone up.  Are you sure? she doesn't answer. After a moment of awkwardness I'm like so that's it? Yeah. A Starbucks doppio (double shot ) is 1.95. I told her that's fine I won't be buying anymore.  This was on 1-12-15 I have had this girl wait on me she has no customer service skills I would hate for her to represent my company.",2
"I was craving the 2 for $5 Bacon/Egg/Cheese biscuit deal after work. Upon ordering, however, the drive thru employee said that they couldn't complete my order because they were 'all out of eggs.' That blows my mind, and it was incredibly disappointing to say the least. To make matters worse, the employee asked if I would like the biscuits just with bacon and cheese, but didn't offer to lower the price. That was ridiculous. Also there is a Kroger across the street, so run over and grab some eggs for goodness sakes!! I drove away unsatisfied and ended up going up the street to get bagels instead.",1
"Terrible location. I've gone a couple times more than an hour and a half before close(which they say is 4pm) and they're all out of everything and can never make any drinks because they're ""cleaning the espresso machine.""  They're also very rude about it and sound annoyed they have to do anything. I'd understand if it was a half hour or less before close but c'mon. An hour and a half to two hours before close they should still have the machines working.",1
Very touresty.  Located in heart of Fanueil Hall.  Food is not very good.,2
"Well, if you've read any of my reviews you already know that i LOATHE faneuil hall.  What do I hate about it?  Oh, how about hte tourists, the cheesey bars, the lousy restaurants, the lack there of cabs at opportune moments...  adding insult to injury?  Sam's Cafe.  It's like a zit on top of a zit.  The fact that we're still talking/exploiting an 80's sitcom like it was still cool in this town is rediculous.  I really hope the only people in here are from Nebraska and are addicted to Nick at Night and really need closure on the fact that Sam Malone isn't real.

But back to basics: Cheesey theme, expensive crappy beers, lame touristy clientel in a crappy location.  Yeah, I don't like it at all!",1
"nooooorrrrrrm!!  if you were here, this place would be a lot better.  definitely touristy, but i wanted to grab a quick drink after work on a hot summer day and sit outdoors.  so, after fighting through the crowds, i ended up here.

the best part of sam's cafe was that you got to keep the cheesy beer mug/drink glasses if you went for the ""big"" drinks.  i made a bet with my notoriously shy companion - the glass would be a prize to be bestowed upon the 20th person wearing madras shorts.  there was a $5 incentive and we did, in fact, make a family here visiting (dad was wearing his madras shorts) both amused and happy.  what does this have to do with the cafe?  nothing.  hence the one star.

the appetizer plate (we got the ""carla"" size) was overpriced, as most things are here.

we were finally driven away by the live entertainment.  i know that's a tough job.  i know.  i stayed through the absolute butchering of ""one"" and ""brown eyed girl"", through the endless country songs, but when i heard ""at first i was afraid, i was petrified . . . "" it was time for the check, pronto.",1
"I'm not quite sure how we ended up here, except that we decided when we saw this while walking around the waterfront that it would be ""cool"" to eat at the Cheers replica. I use that term loosely because neither of us has ever seen Cheers, and it's never really very cool go to a cheesy tourist trap, but hey, whatever.

Thankfully the prices weren't as bad as we were expecting, and the selection of beer was good. Make sure to stay away from the souvenir glasses and gift shop, and save your money. Our server was nice in that kinda cheesy tourist attraction way, but our food was really bad. My burger tasted like cardboard!

If you really want to drink a beer in a place that looks like Cheers, go for it, but don't order the food!",2
"We stopped in here because they were still serving food at 11pm. I knew this is an overpriced tourist trap, but hey, after drinking all day you need to eat! The burger I got was ok...nothing to write home about. My buddy ordered lemon drop shots which were OK. He didn't realize the price until we got the bill and they shots were $8 each! hopefully I will never have to come back here again. Need to find a good late night eats spot in the area!",2
"Cheers is tourism at it's WORST. Yeah, come here once because hell, Cheers was a GREAT sitcom, but don't come here twice because there's nothing fabulous about this place.

It's packed with tourists on a daily basis, so it's definitely not the place where everybody knows your name. The service is good, the food is what you expect (not bad but not memorable either). It's fun for about ten minutes with all the kitchy-ness but after that you just wish you had picked a different restaurant.

With all that Boston has to offer, save yourself the trip, take a picture of the ACTUAL Cheers over on Beacon St. and dine at one of the much, much better restaurants in the area.",1
"I ended up here because we went out with a friend who had on his white Reebok's and we couldn't get into any decent bars, and we were thirsty.  This place is a tourist trap, but tourists pour in a lot of money to the city and state, and we've all been tourists in other cities, so cut them some slack.  I would never go out of my way to spend time drinking and eating here, but it's not a bad spot for one or two quick beers while your friend is looking for a pair of shoes so you can get into a real bar.",2
"""their food can be pretty excellent (as long as you go with heavy stuff like biscuits and gravy, or something hollandaise), but their straight up eggs, pancakes, etc, are just super-blah.  the corned beef hash was squarely middle of the road--i've had much better and much worse, but it's not worth travelling for or skipping the saucier options.

oh yeah.  ""fresh squeezed"" juice comes from a commercially produced jug.  don't buy the hype.

and the service is super-blah to go with it.  except for the hollandaise sauce, i can do way better in my kitchen, and i can do it faster.  which says something, because i am a damn slow cook.""",2
"Hmmm. A lot of food - and nothing really under 7$. Kind of annoying. You have to eat big here and spend the monies. And its not really anything spectacular. Plus, the juice is overpriced.",2
"This place is an over-glorified Denny's.  The options are somewhat better, but that's negated by the fact that the food is brought out lukewarm.  Seriously, I thought it was a one-time thing, but every time I've been to Biscuits my food is cold.

I say if you want a plate of hash and eggs, go for it.  The rest of the food is pretty bland.  Plus, you have to wait a long time for this mediocre food.

The service was fine and therefore will prevent me from only giving it one star.  I never plan on coming to this place again.",2
"The restaurant has only been open two weeks, They still have lots to work out. The waiter  was not very friendly,and didnt no what she was doing. It took us 30 minutes to get are food, when a table came in after us they got there food before us,I think she must of noticed I was not happy,  she came over and told us there was aback up in the kitchen are food would come out shortly.
When it did come out my daughters order was wrong PLUS when she started eating the cheese burger they had kept the paper on the cheese.
I asked to speak to the manger, when he did come over,he told me it was ok that the paper was not from the meat but from the cheese.I didnt understand that,and told him it didnt matter what it was from it should not have been in the meal.He said I could have free dessert.
That wasnt even an option as the waiter didnt even ask about desserts and just gave me the bill.
I will not go back again,I had the fish and chips It looked more like a kids meal.",1
"This newly opened restaurant in West Linn (how many more restaurants can this small town support?) was okay. The waiter said they just opened this week and as of last night they were out of several items. I guess that means they either had a good first few days or they need to figure out their ordering better.

I had high hopes for this restaurant and pub who's catch phrase is 'Comfort Food with a Gourmet Twist'. Sure, they offered lots of traditional fare like Mac & Cheese, Corned Beef, and Fish & Chips...but it's all tweaked just a bit to offer a more updated touch. They also offer a few new things like Eskimo Candy (Salmon marinated in soy and maple. Bits of love with a peppery kick) and Maui Memories (white rice topped with 2 eggs, grilled SPAM and a hamburger patty smothered in brown gravy).

It looks like they are open for breakfast at 10:00 (WTF?) on Saturdays and Sundays only and the breakfast menu looks great....from build-your-own omelets to biscuits & gravy to chicken fried steak and eggs Benedict.

The atmosphere was nice. I can see it being a great local place to pop in for a drink and quiet conversation. However, the food was just so-so. I had the Shepherd's Pie. It came out about 5 minutes after the remainder of my party was brought their food. It was hot but Shepherd's Pie normally comes out with mashed potatoes and cheese on top and is all kind of baked together. Their version tasted more like mashed potatoes on top of Dintey Moore stew. The base itself wasn't rich tasting at all and the potatoes and cheese were just plopped on top. I think a short trip under the Salamander would have made a tiny bit of difference to the look but wouldn't have improved the flavor.

Maybe once they get settled in things will improve but for now, I wouldn't go back here any time soon.",2
"Very average food -- definitely over priced for the poor quality.  Steak was ""uneventful"" and overcooked.  Undercooked vegetables and tasteless mashed potatoes.  Good service.  Desert was very good too but overall a disappointing dining experience.  With all the great restaurants in Boston, I wouldn't bother going back or recommending this to anyone.",1
"I have never been so disappointed in a restaurant before in my life!  I was in Boston on business and my colleagues and I were recommend BlackFin.  The experience was a disaster from the start.  

When they brought out our red wine, the waitress spilled it all over my colleague, me and the table.  They quickly moved us to another table and we tried not to let our sopping business attire get us down.  But then, we got our appetizer.  I have never tasted fried calamari this bad.  It was like chewing on rubber bands.  Then I had the lobster bisque.  I have had lobster bisque many times.  It is a rich and creamy lobster flavored soup.  What they gave me was a broth based soup with a bunch of veggies in it and a biscuit on top.  It has a slight lobster flavor, but I was sure they had made a mistake when bringing me my order --- nope, I was assured that this was in fact the lobster bisque. Maybe that is how it is done in Boston? 

All our entrees were OK --- I got sashimi.  It is pretty hard to mess up sliced pieces of raw fish!  Dessert was OK, my green tea tiramisu was bad but my coworkers chocolate cake was very decedent.  

You would think after the wine incident we would have great service trying to make up for the accident, but I felt very ignored.  Overall it was a terrible experience I was upset that my first and only night in Boston we had such a bad meal!",1
"Why did Tony change get rid of Ambrosia? It was incredible.

So now we're stuck with this wanna-be steak and seafood house. It isn't really anything special like Ambrosia was but of course the prices are still high. This place really lacks the creativity and originality you expect from Tony Ambrose.

Decent appetizers - clams casino, tuna tartare and mushroom risotto. 

Then we had to wait 50 minutes for our entrees because the kitchen couldn't keep up with the party of 12 next to us. Of course my filet mignon at market price was $33 and it was BAD. Over cooked (well done), stringy and for some reason it was butterflied when I asked for it medium. My sister's fish was overcooked and dry.

Of course the waiter apologized and said the mushroom risotto was on the house. YAY! What a slap in the face. I've treated better at Chili's and The Cheesecake Factory.

Tony, what's going on???",2
Very disappointing experience.  Wish I had read more reviews before I wasted my money and time.  The place was empty and we should have left ..... but we gave it a try.  Average steak -- below avergare service -- absolutely nothing special except the outrageous bill for such mediocre food and service!,1
"i can't believe anyone gives this place four stars when there are legitimate 4 star restaurants within a 5 minute walk on pearl st.  if you're a local, i can't imagine you'd go here more than once, though i now have...i thought i'd give it another try after a disappointing visit a year ago.   you feel burned when leaving this place.  it's a classic great location, nice space, type tourist trap restaurant with so-so overpriced food *for the quality* and atrocious service.  i had to walk out of my thanksgiving meal here.  absurdly long wait for service *not particularly busy*, surly waitstaff and proprieter, no utensils or small plates on table; when asked about beers, waiter picked up the wine list on the table, handed it to me, and walked away without a word.  ""oh, i get it, i'm stupid for not knowing i had a wine list on the table with beers listed in it""...yeah, ok, got it.

when i complained to the proprieter about my lack of service and needing to clear my bill, she was surly and rude, and not contrite in the least, leaving me with a sarcastic ""sorry!"" as i left with my kids.  and this on thanksgiving!!!!

final note.  i mentioned this experience to a local friend, and she said her exposure to the 14th st.  was exactly the same the three times she had gone there over several years, ie lousy service.

boulder, and pearl st. in general, has great restaurants.  if you're used to fast food chains in bumf=ck iowa, this place might work for you.  otherwise, visit bacaro, centro, the kitchen, west end, jax, moongate, radda, zolo, laudisio...but don't waste your dough here!",1
"We foolishly stopped by here and were rewarded with a bad meal. The fresh doughnuts were great and I liked the chili vodka bloody mary. Our waiter Sticky was cute but not as experienced as one might like. 

I had the pulled pork and it was cold , the poached eggs on top lukewarm. My companion ordered the 2 egg breakfast. The first time everything on the plate was cold - eggs, sausage, hash browns. We were fist told the breeze had chilled the food, bit we begged to differ. We were then told the sausage had been burned and it sat under a heat lamp while new sausage was cooked. The second time the eggs were warm but the sausage was RAW in the middle. Third time they said they had no more sausage and gave bacon. Again by this time everything else was cold again. They did apologize and took it off the bill, but damage done.

Would never ever ever return, too many other good places in Boulder.",1
"I heard so many good things about this place and I was so disappointed. 

The courses were uneven--sometimes savory, but sometimes just plain bland. The plating was a mess, no direction in concept. My first course, for example, was immersed in a soupy sauce. I was so sad when my delightful little quail egg disappeared underneath the waves.  Where did it go? I wanted to eat you! Though the ingredients were fresh, I didn't feel like they were used to any distinctive or remarkable effect. 

Aside from that, parking is difficult, the location of the restaurant is not really T accessible, particularly on a cold winter day, located in the tiny basement of a brick building. If you're tall, like me, it's no fun bending over to avoid the low beams.  All this could be overlooked if the food and service were stellar. But they weren't.

The seating is disastrous. Despite having made reservations in advance, I was seated in a corner seat in a mostly empty dining room which stuck out into the walking path of most waiters. I kept getting bumped all night with no apologies from the waiters.

I'm a sucker for details in a high-quality restaurant. If someone goes an extra mile on presentation, you know they care not only about the food they serve, but the experience of it as well. Waiters in jeans? why  did I bother to dress up? a clipboard for a menu? UGH. wilted flowers on the table? Baby, if you can't handle fresh flowers, get rid of them. They're only getting in the way of your enormous plates on itty bitty tables anyway.

As for the service, although there were about 5 different servers throughout the night giving me implements, water, etc, there was a serious problem in their communication. In a fine dining restaurant, you don't want every server asking you which plate belongs to who, you want them to know this information in advance and put it down without interrupting your conversation. You also need coordination in the plates--you don't want to sit around for 15 minutes, letting your appetizer get cold because your date's appetizer still isn't ready. tsk tsk. You also don't want to spend $13 on a bottle of sparkling water only to have someone come by and refill your half full glass with tap water.  

You could say Craigie Street Bistro is a competent restaurant. But do you really want to spend a lot of money and time on something that's just competent? Or do you want something special? If you want something special, skip this place.",2
"I'm not a big fan of French food but on occasion my head gets turned by an exceptional place. Unfortunately, Craigie's wasn't much of a head turner for me despite the excellent service and intimately charming decor. 

The meal started out promisingly enough with an unusual but wonderful appetizer: farm-fresh eggs en Concotte. Imagine a hot casserole dish filled with a few sunny side up eggs alongside a mixture of basil blossoms, yellow tomatoes, succotash, and succulent lobster. It didn't look too attractive, but it was out-of-this-world!

The two entrees I sampled were almost unpalatable. The three-pepper and chile-marinated prime hangar steak  with roasted bone marrow, braised greens, and onion puree sounded interesting enough (esp. the marrow part) but was so salty and I could only tolerate a few bites. The roasted breast and thigh of chicken with almonds, roasted vegetables, and polenta had the exact same problem: it was too salty. I'm also not a big fan of dry chicken. 

Perhaps these items were just bad choices (the menu changes daily), but whatever the case, I probably won't return to Craigie's.",2
"I went there for a dinner on Sunday and was very disappointed.  I had suggested it as a place for my friends to take me for my birthday. I was so embarrassed.
The place is charming but the food isn't. We had a hard time deciding what to order because nothing looked good on the menu. One of my pet peeves is when chef's use pig as a seasoning for food. Almost everything on this menu from the salad to fish had some form of pig in it. I know that McDonald's uses bacon to cover up for dry bland food by adding bacon--- what is this place trying to cover. 

I ordered the chicken and it was juicy but the sides were not memorable and lacking interest. One of the people I was with ordered the Striped Bass, which I tried, and it tasted really fishy, something that Striped Bass should not be. 

They told us it would be a 25- 30 minute wait for our entrees and we should order an app. Well none of the apps looked interesting, so I ordered a $12 salad. with nothing but a few flowers and some onion on it. I didn't understand why the food would take that long and I thought it was tacky that I felt obligated to order something.

I use to drive by this place and wonder about it. I will now just drive by it.",1
"So, people really like this place?  I wanted to like it but... We went there for our anniversary, because we wanted a really fancy meal instead of presents.  It was pleasant inside, conducive to having a nice conversation.  (they had diner silverware, and the waitstaff wore jeans, which is odd for a place trying to be upscale, but that's ok) But  we had this very zealous really sweaty waiter, and the chef went absolutely nutty with salt that night.  Everything looked so pretty, but tasted like canned broth - salt, salt, salt.  The fancy sounding dessert was really just a big oreo cookie with vanilla ice cream.  Disappointing.  It had nothing in common with French food we tried in France.",2
"For some reason I was under the impression that this place would be amazing, and despite the smattering of sub-par reviews on this website I decided to give it a try anyway.  I was excited about the fact that everything is advertised as super organic and fresh and local etc, and I was thinking I might be treated to super fresh salads with spinach just picked that morning or something.  Either way, I was wrong.  I started with the octopus and admittedly, the texture was not octopus-like,  It was tender and not at all rubbery.  However, it was so so salty, and I think it would have been amazing if the chef just let the natural taste of the octopus come through.  So that was a bust.  Then I got the fish dish, I think it was called Cobia which came with razor clams and shrimp.  The clams were ok I guess, it was hard to tell since they were sliced into tiny little shreds, unless that's just how razor clams are.  The shrimp I could swear were from a can.  They were tiny and soggy, I make better shrimp at home.  The fish wasn't bad, just your standard white fish, but again, the sauce was so salty I couldn't stand it.  My boyfriend's meal was much better, he got this turnip soup/puree which was good, and the chicken, also good, but if I am going to a ""unique"" restaurant I am not going to order the chicken.  We also ordered this cheesy potato side dish which has the consistency of taffy, I swear.  Not bad, just different.  All in all I don't see what they hype is (if there even is any hype, maybe I hyped this place up in my own mind).  I'd perhaps go back and try something that's not seafood and only if someone else was paying, but I am a very forgiving person for all things relating to food.
  We also got dessert.  I had been thinking we'd skip it since it seems most of the reviews said to, but we got the fruit crisp which I'd give a C, it wasn't piping hot and I couldn't even locate any fruit, and the gingerbread one, which was actually pretty good, but again, for the (possibly imagined) hype of this place I wanted to be blown away and I definitely was not.
   About the decor, and I am only mentioning this as an fyi, I couldn't care less what a restaurant looks like, it's not a show room, it's there to feed me delicious food.  But I was thrown off.  The carpeting reminded me of an elementary school classroom, they type that is put down to cover a cold cement floor (which it probably was) and it was so bright, like, too bright.
   All in all, if this place were 40-50% cheaper I probably would have given it 3 or maybe 4 stars, but again, based on some (probably incorrect) pre-conceived notion of what to expect I was severely disappointed and do not recommend it.",1
"Not nearly up to its pretensions, this cozy but extremely overrated restaurant has a mysteriously loyal following. In fact, we were were taken there as guests of two enthusiastic recommenders, but I really just can't figure out what the attraction is. Though the staff was friendly and competent, and the ambience was friendly (if a bit noisy) the food was almost bad: average ingredients, thrown together haphazardly and then smothered in heavy preparations and sauces. The place is overpriced too: the tasting menus at the nearby T.W.Food serves twice the quantity of (world class) food at the same price.

Craigie Street Bistro is one of those places who's reputation requires some explanation, but I can't come up with one. It is cozy, and in the winter, especially, I can imagine it being a nice place to sit; but the quality of the food is so low, I that I'm just puzzled.

If you must go (don't, but if you must) be warned that parking will be a serious problem. Your best bet is to part on Brattle, near the Armenian Church.",2
"I took the hubby to Craigie Street Bistrot for his birthday, expecting great things since this restaurant was rated as one of the top in the country by Food & Wine Magazine.  Sadly, we were disappointed.  The food was good but not amazing, and the service was not good at all.  We were also seated next to a very loud group; I can't fault the restaurant for that, but it did negatively impact our dining experience.

We wanted to do a 6 course tasting menu, with vegetarian options for me and non-vegetarian options for my husband.  After a couple exchanges with a confusing waiter, we were told this wouldn't be doable.  So, we each went with a market menu, prix fixe.  My food wasn't really described well on the menu, so I got items that were different than what I was expecting, and they didn't taste that amazing.  The hubby fared a bit better (an octopus appetizer contained octopus, the scallop entree had a couple scallops) but his food was also not exceptional.  

The worst part was the service - we asked the waiter to recommend some wine and he just glanced at the first page of the wine list and pointed at the chef's selection (a $70 bottle).  We're not wine connoisseurs, so we went with a more reasonably priced bottle ($35) instead.  I don't know if that offended our waiter or if something else happened, but we barely saw him after that.  Each course was brought out and cleared away by other staff, and he didn't even bother to bring us dessert menus.  Finally, the hostess noticed us sitting there twiddling our thumbs and helped us.

Overall: we wouldn't go back, and we wouldn't recommend this place to anyone else.",2
"For two years I used to live down the street from this place. It was never open. Any time of the day or night I would pass it, not so much of a hint of nightlight shining. I daresay it has not been open in years, if ever. My best guess is it is a ghost diner--a diner that is the hallowed-out shell of a once operating diner. OR, maybe it's a ghost diner in that only ghosts eat here/it only manifests its ghostly image to people who are hunger and in wont of a diner. Why is this even on here, Yelp?",1
"Just so everyone knows, this place has been CLOSED FOR ROUGHLY 10 YEARS...

I forget exactly when it closed, but it couldn't have gone far into the 00s, if at all.  And yes, it has sat there all this time, and surprisingly doesn't took too weathered nor vandalized.  

Anyways, the place wasn't that great when it was open... I remember the service being pretty slow, them having the tendency to mess up your order, break the yolk on your eggs, and the corned beef hash having a weird taste to it.  

But the place was still really busy since they were the only diner at that end of Brighton and was really convenient with all the parking available.  Then the place closed down, had a ""for sale"" sign out front for a long time, and now it just sits there.",2
"I found this place here on yelp thanks to their weekly email.  it was near where I planned to eat lunch.  especially liked the lunch menu of six items under $6.  

the place was mostly empty and you order from the bar, we sat in a booth that was too well lit, the table was sticky and a few flies kept bothering us.

I placed the order and I was given a list of side dish options, including salad.  I selected salad and was given a choice of asian, house or caesar.  I chose the caeser, the bartender asked me what dressing I wanted on that, ""uh... caesar dressing"".

the BLT&A was great.  this was a really good as were the fries with old bay.  my chicken sandwich was pretty good but we found a bone in the breast.  caeser was decent too.  also had chips and salsa/queso.  the chips were stale (too chewy)

we were reasonably satisfied with our food and decided not to issue opinion until we returned to enjoy some of the great selection of draft beers.  the bill seemed larger than the $6 per should have offered, I found that my $6 chicken sandwich was $8.45, this was attributed to the fact that I got the caesar that was one of my choices of sides.... because.  the lunch came to around $24.

then, this morning I checked my bank balance.  it said I was negative $674.  ""how could this be"" I wondered.  then at the top of the page was a pending debit from drongo for $1k, (ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS).  I had to run to the bank and cough up cash to get my account to show positive.

first thing I did was call drongo.  the guy on the phone seemed concerned and did apologize, asked for my phone number so he can call me back after he calls his credit card processing company.  four hours later and I have not received that call.  my bank said I am helpless to do anything but wait till midnight and see if it hard posts or goes away (it should go away)

(update from next morning, the charge is still on my acct)
(update from friday eve, over 48 hrs after my lunch on wed and the $1K debit to my account has NOT been removed...)

I hit all dollar marks on the price indicator as $1k is a lot to pay for lunch

update:  I just received a call from the manager and he did sincerely apologize but had no real answer for the error.  said they charge should drop off tonight, as well as the $24 for my meal.  

free food always tastes better, I'll make good on my original pledge to go back to have a black/tan or the likes. but I'll probably pay with cash.",2
"not ummm.... well, not good. I went for a first time, and it was average, then the second time it was just downright awful. My 15 dollar pizza (the supposedly ""wonderful"" chesapeake pizza) had burnt crust and the shrimp was downright rotten, I had to pull it off and not eat it. Small frozen shrimp that had probably been sitting out all day. very gross....

and on the sandwiches, they use the poorest bread. I mean, the turkey sandwich my friend got they used generic white bread... i mean.. .really? theyre across the street from texas french bread for god's sake!

Which leads me to the ""savvy"" owner. Some seriously poor decisions here... one, that cowboy hat. cmon you look ridiculous! The order at the bar before you sit down is another awful idea. lot's of people came in at once and it was just mess. Then a large group of sorority girls came in and he couldnt do anything but drool over himself. He stopped me mid-order so he could get all creepy and try to hit on the obliviously dumb girls. creepy, stupid owner. 

Maybe the location isn't cursed, but rather people just keep opening crappy restaurants... 

also waaaay too campusy. cant you girls find anything else to wear other than those ridiculous nike shorts? it's like wearing a slut badge...",2
"One thing's for sure. The Drungo Ice House definitely knows how to entice people to relax. You can sit at a table in the outdoor patio, at an indoor four-seater, in a booth, and even a retro-styled couch which affords you a perfect view of the CD jukebox, the pool table, and the dartboards. Next time I need a place to duck into to wait out a rain storm similar to what we had this past Tuesday I'll look no further. 

However, the food and service need to catch up to the commitment to aesthetic if it's going to stick around much longer. For example, upon walking in the door I asked one member of the staff if I could grab a table anywhere. He confirmed that I could, and handed me a menu. I went to a booth and sat for several minutes until finally, a female member of the crew asked if I was waiting for someone. I said it was only me, which prompted her to inform me you place your order at the bar. The guy who handed me the menu could've informed me of that. Don't feel like I needed to pry that piece of info out of anyone given it was my first time and I can be forgiven for not instantly knowing the concept. The lady apologized for not clarifying that for me and proceeded to take my order. 

I opened with their Caesar salad. Agreeable enough offering. Romaine lettuce, Parmesan cheese, Caesar dressing, and croutons. The croutons had an appealing taste and appearance. Definitely not like what you'd get from a box at the grocery store. Zestful cheese. Dressing had punch without spoiling the smooth taste of the other components. Nice foundation to a meal. 

For the main course, since I hadn't had one in ages, I chose the fried Gulf shrimp Po' Boy. Their usual oyster Po' Boy comes to $8.95. Tack on an added $2.50 for the shrimp substitution. I had to detach the shrimp from the huge toasted French roll they were presented in because, uber-doofus that I am, I neglected to account for the fact the tails were still attached. Turned into a eat the fish, pull the tail at the same time sort of activity. Slaw is nestled beneath it. Likable but I have had better in Biloxi whilst on vacation. 

All burgers and sandwiches come with either Old Bay seasoned fries, Cole slaw, or potato salad. I decided on potato salad which suffered from the same fate I've had to endure with Cole slaw at other restaurants... a preponderance of black pepper. I know it's supposed to lend some attitude to what might be thought of as a somewhat dull side dish but come on, does it have to be swimming in the stuff?Makes me have to be overly cautious about how much I bite into at once. Luckily I had pink lemonade to douse the tingling. Come to think of it the drink ended up being the most favorable part of the meal, which isn't exactly a high compliment. The slaw had copious black pepper too. If you have to go to such extra effort to liven up a side dish that doesn't make me feel like it's all that memorable. Please allow me to taste and therefore have a chance to appreciate what I'm swallowing, 'kay? 

The meal came to a grand (or given the quality of what I just ate should I say mediocre?) total of $22.88. That's a shade too much for what amounts to a funked up slacker hangout. Atmosphere's an important start. The Drungo Ice House needs to work on follow-through or we'll soon be wondering what's going to take its place in that location.",2
"DAMNIT!!
Jebus Las Vegas, people! Pay attention!

When are restaurant owners going to learn to NOT listen to the customers?!

Ok. I was going to bump this place up to 4-5 stars. I'd been there a few more times and really enjoyed my food and service even more than the previous visits.

BUT, on a lovely day I took a ride and ended up at the Drungo for lunch yet again. I was terribly excited about trying the crabcake burger. 
""Nope, we don't carry that anymore.""
??
Ok. Well, Maybe I'll try that really great-sounding seafood pizza.
""We don't have pizzas."" 
Grrr....
Well, then, I guess I'll just go with my go-to for this place, the crab balls.
""Um...yeah, we don't have those either.""
!@$%&*%(#!!
WTF?!

Are you kidding me?!
You just took away ALL the things that made you cool and different from most other beer and food joints in Austin.

Frantically, I searched over your new menu, trying to find something of a saving grace that interested me. It wasn't there. The only thing that is on the menu that had crab anymore is the crab dip, and that ain't lunch. 

I realize that maybe the business wasn't what you were hoping for, but these are also difficult times for all of us. Leaning back toward mediocrity because it's what you think the customer wants isn't the answer.

I want my Drungo's back!!",2
"I showed up to Drungo for the Geeks Who Drink Pub Trivia last month.  After ordering a few over priced drinks and a grilled cheese sammich which was entirely too greasy (though the fries were yummy), I went to pay my tab at the end of trivia.  I remember thinking to myself that $30 seemed like a lot of money for dinner and drinks just for myself, but chalked it up to being my fault for not paying closer attention to the prices of the drinks.

Two weeks later I check my bank account to find two charges from Drungo.  One for my actual tab and another for $10.  The charges were not pending, but actually posted as debited from my bank account.  Thinking this may have just been an honest mistake, I call Drungo's and speak to a manager who feeds me a BS line about how banks sometimes pull out an extra $10 or $20 for a ""preauthorization"" on a tab, but that the charge would be gone in the next couple of days.  I realize this is sometimes true, but that preauthorization charge only appears as pending until the charge for the actual check is posted as debited from your bank account.  The manager says he'll call the bank to find out what happened and took my name and number and says he'll call me back before the end of the day. 

Flash forward another week.  I never heard back from the manager and the charge is STILL posted to my bank account.  I think this may be the first time I'll take a step beyond yelp and report a business to the BBB for flat out STEALING from me and doing nothing to rectify the situation.

Anything redeeming qualities about this place don't deserve mentioning because of the shady way they do business.",1
"This place is nothing special...I had the veggie samosas (2) with optional chips or salad, it was around $8, and wasn't as good as the samosas you can find in Safeway etc.  It's a busy spot but I think that's more to do with location (foyer of a busy building) than anything else.  Having said that, there seems to be a wide variety of items available....not sure how pushed I am about going back though.",2
"I grabbed a quick lunch after an appointment today. The chicken Caesar wrap looked huge and came with a bag of chips, so I parted ways with $7.75 and took it with me. I was extremely disappointed to discover that it was absolutely STUFFED with white rice to fill it. There was some lettuce and very few thin shreds of chicken - definitely not what I had hoped (or paid) for! I got taken for a ride and wouldn't ever eat here again.",2
"Quite possibly the worst meal I have had in a very long time!  $12 for a spongy doughy quiche with a few lettuce leaves and watered down turmeric latte! 
It's very unfortunate that people who are unwell and possibly in distress should not have the choice of higher quality food. 
I am giving a 1 star rating because there isn't an option to give a zero!",1
"I work in the building and eat here occasionally.  I wouldn't call it fantastic or anything, but it's convenient and the food is passable.  However, they lost me as a customer forever when I popped down to grab a cup of soup and was told that they stopped serving hot food at 2:00 p.m.  It was 2:05 p.m. when I arrived.  How hard could it be to scoop out a cup of soup.  It couldn't possibly have gone cold in five minutes.  I'm sorry, but to turn away a repeat customer over something so minor shows pure laziness.  There were at least five employees working at the time.  Their unwillingness to bend a little showed me exactly how much they value my business and I will be responding by taking my business elsewhere in the future , even if it may be slightly more inconvenient.  There is another restaurant with better food right next door and they will be getting my money from here on out.",1
"They let the food go cold,and I just have to say that their going down w/the'hood.It's great when you're low-income&broke,because that's what the apartments surrounding the place are.I'd love to have a nice,quiet dinner,but can't when some minority drives by w/subwoofers blaring ,then parks at the Diamond Shamrock,w/the car running.Not a racist remark by any means,just the damn truth.",2
"This place used to be good a couple of years back. A recent visit forced me to revamp my opinion of this place. Stale - as in 'old', 'smelly' chicken -and hardly ANY choices worth exploring in their buffet. Yes - the 'on-demand' stir fry saves the day for some - but even that was mediocre. The buffet has gone from an 8 (on 10) to about a 3! (on 10).  2 out of 3 people in our party had stomach problems (possibly the fried fish on the buffet...)
In any case, this is no longer a place I will be setting foot into...",1
Wokaholic is good for the price but not that special typical Chinese Buffet. It is very convenient for Wells Branchian,2
yuck! old food...super greasy. not worth your time,2
"First time here.  Service was good, server was attentive and food came out in a reasonable time. It's very loud in the restaurant, which most are today. 

We were a party of six. The table we were sat at held 6 comfortably. However, the table was way to small for the space we all had to sit on the edge of the booth seats and lean way in to eat our dinner.  

Food was average at best. The pork belly and mussels was by far the best dish.  We had the family platter $32, came we 3 cheeses, 3 meats both super small portions, a few olives, bread, a carrot, some dried grapes and bread.  Bread was very good!  House made bologna not good, terrine was yummy. Cheeses were just ok. Too expensive. 

Some of us had the duck entree.  Duck was tough and had too much liver rolled in with it. Liver is so pungent it doesn't take much to over do it.  Veggie entree boring, not very flavorful, my friend said the burger was very good.  My husband at the rabbit entree not much flavor. Have had better duck and rabbit at many other places.

Menu looks and sounds great but the flavors just are not there.


The cocktails we had were very good.",2
Critically flawed service. Clueless regarding available liquors and no knowledge of wines.  Unfamiliar with menu.  Food okay.  When it finally arrived.  Don't go.,2
"Disappointed. 1. The food was not amazing. We ordered 4 small plates and 3 main courses, and not one was great. The trout and salmon were fine but not memorable, and the tagliatelle, which was supposed to have pork sausage, had but two small sausage pieces. None of the small plates was particularly good. The touted venison was overly sweet, the touted octopus/shrimp terrine did not have a lot of taste, and the vegetable dish we tried was bland. 
2. One of the two wines we ordered had a lot of sediment at the bottom of the glass, but the beers were good. 3. We asked for one order of bread. AN ORDER OF BREAD - $5 - was 3 not very fresh, not very warm rolls. AND, WITHOUT ASKING WE WERE GIVEN TWO ORDERS AND BILLED $10 FOR 6 MEDIUM SIZE ROLLS THAT WEREN'T SPECIAL. We only saw tables of 2 and 4 diners when we were dining. Three rolls per order? Really? Note that when we questioned why we were brought and charged for two orders when we requested one, the charges for both were removed. 
4. The wait staff seem nice. When it was clear I was not eating the octopus/shrimp, the server offered to replace it. I declined. But they did offer. 

I hope this restaurant improves with time. It would be great to have a place that serves interesting and innovative dishes that are as locally sourced as possible. It has a long way to go, though.",2
"We had a horrible experience here. As with many other reviews, we hope it's just a ""new restaurant"" issue but, the food wasn't impressive and neither was the service. The waitstaff, although friendly, seemed to have never seen the menu and drinks took forever as did the food. The octopus had little flavor. The duck was almost impossible to eat. Full of fat and chewy sections. I did like the side of potatoes. For the amount of money we spent, we definitely didn't get the experience.",2
"I really wanted to like this restaurant based on its Wrecking Bar chops. I didn't. 

The Organization and the Room: A nice, limited renovation from the Cakes and Ale space. Thirty-five minutes late to be seated for an 8:00 reservation for four. My ""Meller Yeller"" rhum/orgeat/turmeric cocktail was interesting enough. Host staff was generally apologetic (the leader came by to bring us some bagels to take home later on, but in a bizarre way -- four in one bag for us to what, split up and carry loose on the way home? Also, they were labeled ""EOD bagels,"" which I can only assume means ""end of day,"" and is not particularly enticing). 

Meeting the Server: Took 10 minutes to get water and be greeted. Ordered a bottle of wine, repeating the name twice and pointing to it on the menu. Still received the wrong bottle. I guess I can understand mistaking the Kerner I wanted for the Grüner I got, but I'm not sure the server even knew the menu well enough to know the Kerner was there. Instead of expediting the right bottle, our server took another table's order and bussed yet another table before producing our wine.  Then, when taking our order, didn't manage to tell us that the chicken had been 86'd until someone tried to order it. 

The Food and Wine: True to form, the shared ""Family Platter"" of well sourced cheeses, homemade charcuterie, pickles and veg were reasonably strong -- an elevated version of Wrecking Bar classics. It was mostly downhill from there. The clams/pork belly/bonito was inspired but super heavy. The octopus and shrimp terrine was flavorful and left me optimistic. The entrees dashed those hopes. My duck roulade (server's recommendation) was a fatty, gristly mess. And I'm not one to complain about a rich and fatty meat dish. But the execution on the duck was shockingly poor. The meat portion of the NY strip (another recommendation) was edible; the fat portion was not -- unrendered and gelatinous. Again, I'm not one to shy away from fatty meats, but this was quite poor at the $39 price point. The trout and ""Market"" tilefish ordered by my tablemates (but not tried by me) were reported as ""fine,"" but not something that they'd order again. Sides of potatoes with sour cream, Sea Island peas, sunchokes and carrots with tahini and za'atar were good, as were the chanterelles that they graciously provided since they were a strong draw for the steak-eater who was hoping for the chicken dish. The Cruse Valdiguié was an awesome bottle of wine, though the gentleman who served it somehow managed to pour nearly two-thirds of the bottle into three glasses before forgetting to pour any more than the initial taste for me, the one who ordered the wine. That said, it was cool to see the passion of the bar manager (?) who later came by and was excited that we had ordered that wine. 

The Service (Part 2): Presumptuous and not terribly helpful. An order of dinner rolls became two without us asking. A second order of potatoes was brought despite the fact that the steak dish came with the same side (and our server knew we were sharing all the sides). A second bottle of red wine was mistakenly brought when we had asked for another ""bottle"" (carafe) of water to be brought to the table after one that was left for us to serve ourselves from was never brought back full after we had emptied it. The served seemed a little miffed, as she had already opened the (unordered) bottle of wine before she got to the table (which she never should have done in the first place).

Conclusion: Wanted to like it, but can't say that we did. We'll go back -- but not for six months. Both the food and the service need a ton of work for a restaurant of this price point. Hope it's still there by the time we're ready to give it another try?",2
"The service we had was really good but the food was below average. My wife had the risotto and I had the venison, both of which were recommended by our server. The risotto was extremely salty and the venison was not very flavorful and and under dome for my taste. I didn't even finish my meal and actually spit out the last bite I had. There was also nothing to the plate - no vegetables were served with the venison except about two pieces of potato. Wasn't impressed either the cocktails either. Very underwhelming, especially with all the awesome choices in Decatur. I got a negative review from a friend as well so I don't think we will go back for another try.",1
"was there recently mid week for a dinner around 8 pm. What a horrible experience....here's why:
- the hostess had a bunch of food at her front desk and she was more concerned about eating rather than helping out her staff which was slim to none. besides there was no one else in the place
- the steak tip entree i ordered was meak. it had 4 very small pieces of steak on the dish - i was starving after i ate,  what a huge waste of money
- the fried plantains were overcooked and had hair on them.
- service was non existant
- the fish and chips were like somehting u buy in a box and throw in the microwave

i hope to never ever go back to a naked fish in my life",1
"The Naked Fish has a nice ambiance, but the food is blase.

We started off with the sangria.  Naked Fish's sangria is red wine, ""fruit"" (lemon, lime, and orange), and an orange liquor.  I don't know about anyone else, but when I have sangria I want fruit like peaches, strawberry, apple, entice me a little, not with some decoration fruit for cocktails.  Also I like sangria with a LOT more alcohol, for example Joe's Bar & Grill, hands down best sangria, with different varieties of Hard A in the sangria.

Next we had the calamari which lacked flavor and left me with a feeling of guilt for eating tasteless fried food.  If I am going to splurge on fatty goodness, better have the goodness.

The crab cake appetizer -  was phenomenal.  But the meal experience can't ride on those Maryland babies.

I then switched to the Pomoso drink, which is champagne, pomegranate juice, and something else...  The champagne lacked bubbles.  Meaning the bottle was sitting open for quite some time.


I then had the blackened scallop salad (my fault for ordering the salad, should have chosen a special) it was drenched with dressing, and the scallops tasted way to salty.

I left the naked fish feeling bloated with all the salt and it just wasn't worth it.",1
"talk about phoning it in. 

so my aunt and uncle wanted to take us out, win! however, they went to legals yesterday so we landed up here, fail! 

the service was cordial, but slow and thats not a good thing. granted it was 530 on a friday and the place was at maybe 50% at that point. mer got the sword special, she said it was greasy. auntie had the mojo shrimp, i had one, it was fine, nothing spectacular for sure. i on the other hand saw idaho ( no you da ho) stuffed trout. normally when i go out i find myself wanting items that i never wanted to cook at home, so this sounded good. i asked how the stuffing was prepared, and they told me like a crab cake, ok then. well it came out and it was two paper thing trout fillets with two crab cakes in inside, literally, one fillet face up, two cakes, one fillet (skin on no less) face down. weaksauce. the sauce it came with didnt make a difference, but it sounded good. 

no apps or drinks and the bill still rang up to almost 100 bucks. so if water covers 75% of the earth, why does seafood cost twice as much as landfood. can i call a sandwich landfood? i think i will.",2
"This location was our first experience w/ the Naked Fish chain, and I'll just say we were less than impressed.

The service overall was good to great. We were never without drinks or had to wait long for food. 

The food, however, is completely lacking in flavor. We thought, going to a Cuban restaurant, we'd find tons of flavor and spice in the food. Not so. Everything we had (crabcakes, caesar and green salads, seabass, chicken, steak tips & chocolate molten cake dessert) was severely lacking in flavor. Everything was SO bland. The dessert was even microwaved in order to be heated, I have to say that I was appalled. 

For the prices here, it is definitely not worth the money. There are other restaurants in the area where the value is far higher. We most likely will not be back, unless we hear differently from friends.",2
"This chain of trying to be different Cuban seafood spots is just a terrible place to eat and drink for that matter. They used to have a spot in downtown Boston but it closed due to lack of business probably. This location sits near the new Natick Collection Mall. What it amounts to is a attempting at being hip place that has snobby service and all around bad menu selections. The interior is badly decorated and has low lighting so you can't see what you are eating. The hostess think they are in New York city instead of working at a mediocre chain restaurant in metro west. They act like they are doing you a favor. The drinks are trying to be creative with margaritas of sorts and others, I ordered a mango margarita that tasted so bad I had to send it back and order something else, the wait person remarked ""you know you have to pay for that right?"" as if I didn't know. The menu selections are complete mess of various bad concoctins of cuban seafood and other terrible items. I ordered a sort of blackened fish which came out burned and was dry as any I have ever had. You would think being close to Boston and the seafood capital of the US that this place could get it right. Not so. In all it was a bad experience that was way overpriced. I would skip this dive and visit a better restaurant of which there are about a hundred in this area. As for this place it is a tremendous joke.",1
"Four or five years ago my wife and I used to go to the Naked Fish once a week.  Whatever night it was, the bar was always full and it was always plenty of fun. 

Last night we were planning to meet my parents and they suggested the Fish.  My wife and I arrived early and were pretty sadly shocked.  It was 9:00 and the parking lot was virtually empty.  When we went inside there were only three people in the bar.  We noticed that lights were out, bottles were missing and the AC was set for a full room (which meant it was freezing).

It had the depressing feel of a business about to go under.  We had our drinks and left when my parents arrived.

This isn't to say there were no positives though.  The bartender was really good.",2
The Iguana Cantina is a cute-little Mexican restaurant/ bar.  The waitstaff isn't all too friendly- but great eye candy for the guys to look at!  The bar tenders usually lack a personality as well and aren't too quick with the service (the first time I went was Cinco de Mayo so I assumed it was because they were swamped/ went again on a normal night and they were still slow!).  The best thing about that place are the decorations and art on the wall(s).,1
"Boo on this place. Maybe I am too attached to the Border Cafe, but this food doesn't really pass muster for me. The food was pretty tasteless in my opinion. Maybe people like it so much because the margarita aftertaste masks the lack of flavor. Thanks, but no thanks.",1
"This place sucked. I got dragged here several times for work functions. I grew up on the West Coast with great Mexican food, and they didn't even come close. Bad Tex-Mex was more like it. I'm glad they closed. I hope the replacement is something better.",1
"A miserable place.  Crappy food, with one exception (see below).  And newsflash:  the drinks are WATERED DOWN.  That margarita in your hand is a huge pile of ice in a tumbler full of sour mix with a spritz of tequila.  If you thought you got drunk at Iguana, you either drank about 20 of those, or you were imagining it all.  Maybe you were hallucinating from the nasty burrito you ate.  Sorry.

The one exception to the food being craptastic is Snake Bites - jalepeno poppers made with pickled peppers that are actually quite spicy and fantastic.  That is, if they still serve them.  I haven't set foot in the place since I quit working there in college because I could no longer tolerate the unbridled smarminess of it all.

Don't bother coming here.  It is an h-hole.",1
"If you like eating in a restaurant piled high with at least 3 inches of dust on their various knick-knacks, then yes, this is the place for you. They have this talking crocodile as you walk in and out of here, as well as way too much random ""junk"" decorating this place. I'm not even sure what they're trying to do especially since they're supposed to be going for Mexican. At any rate, if you're looking for a drink because everywhere else is packed, then by all means. If you're looking for a good Mexican dinner, I would suggest you go to Margaritas (which isn't great authentic Mexican food - which we don't really have in Waltham anyway, but much better than this) down the street instead.",2
"The food here is just plain not good- my enchilada tasted as if they put bbq sauce on it!  However, I do love their frozen margaritas (MUCH better than Margaritas down the street).  I'd skip this place if you're looking for a meal, but if you're in a 'rita mood, this is the place to go on Moody!",2
"I would rather have my feet sawed off than eat at Iguana's. TRUST ME.

 They aren't even worth getting into detail, but if you want to eat overpriced and  bland non authentic food at a place frequented by local Walthamites, served by a bunch of drug fueled idiots with a side of the bottomless pit of chips and salsa (Do you WANT to know what is at the bottom of the pit?)

 Have fun.",1
"Sadly, out of business. Being replaced by a new place, New Landing Restaurant....opening this Saturday, August 9.",1
"A friend and I decided to go to Iguana Cantina for a margarita last night for Cindo De Mayo.  For some reason a big black bouncer found it necessary, after he ID'd us, to put a giant black check mark on my right hand with permanent marker!!!  
Not only will this not come off my right hand, but I slept on my hand and now there is a giant black check on my left cheek as well.  I have to go to church with my family today and I'm currently in the bathroom scrubbing my face and right hand with a SOS pad.  This hurts A LOT!!!  And it's not even completely coming off!!!   
All this for a shitty margarita that just tasted like pure sour mix!!!",1
"From sitting down to leaving almost 2 hours later this restaurant is horrible.  Service, food quality, and manager's approach was atrocious.  Server got everything wrong, brought food that we never ordered, put it on our receipt.  The food was either burnt or undercooked when we finally got everything we ordered.  We finally asked for a manager and a new server it was so bad.  Will never set foot in a Denny's again after this experience - should have gone to McDonalds at least we would have got the same meal in a timely manner and a better price.  After the whole fiasco the manager only gave us twenty percent off the order.",1
"The service suck, they are not organized and all the employees need to be train. Poor customer service. I came three time and the three time I seen poor customer service and a big mess with taking order.",1
"One word: horrible !! Terrible service, took an hour for scrambled eggs toast and fruits. Never again.",1
"We came for breakfast and had huge servings of french toast and pancakes. Everything came out quickly, it was clean and service was friendly. I can't say anything bad about it, but you do leave a few pounds heavier if you consume the whole meal.
I love american breakfast.",1
Owner whistles at me like a dog in the parking lot for parking in the wrong spot. Could have been a lot more respectful and asked me nicely to move.,1
"Bad service, didn't give us any orange when we asked for it many times.

We came here and the restaurant is empty. They charging us for orange and side dishes when they didn't have any oranges left. We asked for plum juice and they didn't have any either. 

The stove is not environmentally friendly as they are using gas stove. The pot takes forever to boil and they can't do anything about it. Overall, bad attitude and service.",2
"I liked the food here, but the service was where it was lacking. 
This is an All You Can Eat HotPot restaurant. 
We went for dinner and the menu was explained to us. All the meats and sides came with he meal. There was a big assortment of beef, pork, seafood, and even innards like tripe. The vegetables ranged from mushrooms, spinach, and other leafy greens. That is a set price.

The pot to cook your food in is where it can get expensive. Each broth is priced differently. if you get a second broth for a split pot, they only charge for the one that is priced higher. On top of that, there is a sauce station that they charge for once, per person. 
AYCE Menu ($22.99) + Soup Base ($13-$35) + Sauce ($3) = Meal

We chose a Spicy Broth and then the Herbal to try the best of both worlds. When they say Spicy, they mean spicy. It was a good numbing soup base. It was delicious. The herbal broth didn't have a strong taste, but that was fine. You can make up your flavors at the sauce bar. 
The sauce bar had about 10 difference sauces, like spicy garlic, sambal, sesame, etc. 

The service was up in the air. So, you're given a menu and you mark off what you want for every round. I think we went through about 4 rounds, and 2 of them we didn't get our menu back. One of the women said that they lost our menu, so we ordered on a used menu. That would have been fine if we were given our correct orders. Every time there were multiple things missing. When we'd ask for the items, they'd be forgotten. 
When the restaurant started to die down a little bit, the staff began to clean up. That's fine too, but one of them pulled out a vacuum an started to clean the floor...
He was bumping the tables and our chairs, trying to get the vacuum under our table. 
Now that I think about it, it's a good chuckle, but at the time I felt really uncomfortable.",2
This place is nasty. They do not wear hairnets or gloves and I have seen them actually take their bare hand to put things on the plate.,1
"Surprised that people give this place such high ratings. I had it once because I was craving some soul food but will never go here again. The food wasn't particularly bad but it just wasn't very good either. I had a four side ""veggie"" plate which costs $5.65. I was happy that the collards weren't made with pork but they were a bit bland. I couldn't tell what kind of cheese was used for the Mac and Cheese which concerned me. It was a very gooey consistency. The rice was marginally okay. Black eyed peas were too salty and mushy. However I did like the cornbread.

The place is very old and dingy looking which is very unappetizing however it did appear clean to the eye.",2
"Well, I don't know...maybe it's just me, but I find Oga's a half-hearted attempt at true Southern food.  Even the Green Tomato in Powder Springs beats this place.  I've eaten there several times over the years because where I've worked, it was the closest place with some sort of ""healthy"" food, at least better than a freakin burger off the dollar menu...which is right about where I rate Oga's.  

The last time I went was last week.  I had Country Fried Steak...or what was SUPPOSED to be Country Fried Steak, but it was a stupid hamburger patty, breaded in some cheap breading and then fried hard...too hard.  She did give me a choice of white or brown gravy...which I like white gravy and their's was decent.  It's a mix, but better than some I've had.  The collards...I can't complain about.  They were ok...a bit bland.  The mashed potatoes were ok...again, a bit bland.  They were real, not instant.  They had some large, unmashed chunks in them, but that was ok.  The person I was with had macaroni and cheese...HOW CAN ANYONE ON HERE SAY THEIR MAC N CHEESE IS GOOD?????  Ugh! It's freakin cheap cheese sauce...not even good cheese sauce but the real, real orangey, very thin kind????  

The Steak was the biggest downer.  I couldn't even eat it...it reminded me of the ""steak patties"" or ""chuck wagon patties"" that come in a big plastic sleeve at Wal-Mart where you get like 18 patties for only $3.99...HORRID VENDING MACHINE FOOD!

The waitress was nice but she was the only waitress.  We had to wait forever to get refills on our tea or to get our bill.  The place is smelly and FILTHY!  Their bathrooms smell like they do a half-hearted attempt to clean them, but they are not clean at all.  It's like they mop the floors, but don't sweep before they mop and just mop the dirt around on the floors.  

For me, Oga's has always been a disappointment, whatever location you find.  This owner was nicer here than the one on Powder Springs Road, but the food just isn't there.  Go to Picadilly or Publix for goodness sakes!",2
"Not a big fan of ""southern food"", but I have to admit this place had the best banana pudding I have ever had.  I would go back just for the banana pudding!",2
"Awful.  Veggies sitting in water all day?  I live asking the corner.  There's no way I would go back.  If authentic means canned veggies and frozen burgers, go for it.",1
"This place was bragged upon by  my late Father'n law. So  one rainy day I decided to try after being skeptical. Not to my surprise the service was rude and I was almost beaten out of $5.00, had I not spoken up. I got fried fish which she said was tilapia but end up being Catfish! GROSS!! I hate catfish! I didn't know onion rings was separated from the other sides. Wait for it.... IT WAS HAIR ALL IN THE BAG N STYROFOAM CONTAINER! Didn't eat so wasted $25 on Nothing! So upsetting .. Lesson Learned‍",1
"Horrific in every way!  Don't do it!!  I wanted some good down home southern cooking.  What a mistake.  First of all the place has no charm, but hey that actually gave me hope.  Usually, hole in the wall type restaurants are the best ones.  NOT!!!  I ordered cabbage, meatloaf and macaroni and cheese.  Absolutely nothing looked appetizing.  The cabbage was water logged.  The macaroni and cheese was the deep yellow you get when you make the packaged variety and it tasted like it too. Definitely not southern style. The meatloaf was the best item on the plate, but nothing to seek out.  I will not step foot in this establishment again.  Terrible, terrible food.",1
"DISGUSTING. I ordered homefries (small cubed potatoes fried untill tender) and bacon still wiggly and pink. I recieved canned potatoes that were fried up, and crispy bacon wrapped in a peice of curly long hair. They must make a big profit charging 2.75 for canned potatoes. Thats what grandma would want right? NEVER GOING BACK. I almost vomited on my plate :0",1
"We kept driving by Gram's and saw lots of cars there every time.  That NORMALLY is a key clue that the place might actually have some decent food.

UH, I guess it must be a matter of taste and palate because the food was barely mediocre.

We stopped for lunch.  The first thing we noticed was how the interior was quite shabby with lots of grime and dust on things and very outdated.  The second thing we noticed were the many advertisements painted onto the walls--not that the paintings weren't done well--they were...but frankly, not something I want to look at when I'm eating a meal.  I'm sure they thought they were being both clever--as I'm sure the advertisers pay a fee for their ad to be on the walls--but also perhaps the restaurant owners think they are providing a service to their customers.  Frankly, in my opinion, if I want to know more about the businesses that provide good services, the restaurant would do better to have a display case where the businesses can put their business cards--yeah, they could still pay for the right to do so and then the guests wouldn't feel so inundated with ad information.  

The very ironic thing is that the traditional location where a restaurant has advertisements...was blank--that being the placemats. 

Now the food--I ordered an open faced roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy.  The white bread was not grilled, not heated...just plain sandwich bread.  The potatoes were clearly instant and the gravy was also an instant.  There was nothing about the plate that said UMMMM, YUMMY, I GOTTA GET ME MORE OF THIS.  The roast beef actually was on the verge of being beyond its serving date and had a lot of gristle and fat--it was not sliced roast beef but clearly reused from some other menu item.  The cole slaw was good--don't know if they made the slaw itself or bought it precut and ready to dress.  

The MENU had about 300 things on it.  And all I could think after eating the not so fabulous open faced roast beef was....they desperately need Robert Irvine to help them figure out whether they are a restaurant or an ad agency and they desperately need to figure out what they do exceptionally and stick with that.  

Service was okay--not exceptional.  When we first entered, we did not know whether we needed to wait to be seated or seat ourselves as there was no directional signs and no one bothered to let us know until finally a man who apparently was one of the wait staff said we could seat ourselves wherever we liked.  As we began to move into the other room he said, ""except in there.""  We stopped in our tracks.  He started laughing and said, ""OH, I was just kidding.""  JUST FYI...not a great thing to make your guests feel STUPID. I'm sure he thought he was funny.  We did not.  The lady that served us our lunch was just mediocre--she did nothing exceptional and nothing terrible--but just didn't seem to care much one way or the other. 

In all honesty, this trip to Gram's will be our first...and our last.  We will look for better fare, service and ambiance elsewhere.  Prices were a bit high given what the food was like as well.  I think the many cars in the parking lot must be regular locals who don't know any better and are stuck in a rut because this was not a good dining experience.",1
"Pros: We got refills before our food arrived when the drinks were low.

Cons: The server dropped off our food and never came back.
There was hair in my hashbrowns.
The hashbrowns were way undercooked and still watery.

Boo :[",1
I have been twice and do not plan to go back. Both times I went the service was slow and the food average. You can seat yourself and both times I went it was only dirty tables and had to wait for them to be cleaned off. They should consider having people wait so that the waitresses can clean off the tables.,2
"Update:
Went for breakfast sat next to two gentleman as they ordered breakfast. Their food arrived and when asked by the waitress, a tall blonde lady, if everything was good, one man said that his steak did not taste quite right and that he was not going to consume it. The waitress asked if he wanted something different and he replied, no. 
The man ate the eggs toast and potatoes, however when his bill came he told his companion the he had in fact been charged for the bad steak, his friend said "" they'll take it off when you pay"", however the steak remained on the plate uneaten and on the bill. As they left both agreed never to come into the restaurant again!
Customer satisfaction should be a priority. Shame on the staff for not addressing this issue, but it appeared they were more concerned with the tip than the service.",1
Myself and 2 other guys from work just tried there homemade bisquits & gravy.. not even close to good. Had to throw it away.. tasteless gravy that should not even be served.. come on... how hard is it to make sausage gravy???,1
"Not too pleased with my breakfast. The bacon tasted like it was cooked in a fryer, the eggs were cooked over medium and the bread was of poor quality. The kids enjoyed their pancakes and french toast so maybe it was just luck of the draw.",2
"Quinnie's is out of business and their space in the shopping center is empty.  I ate there once and didn't find any reason to return, so it doesn't upset me.  There is a brand new Subway right next door, though.",1
"If I could give 0 STARS... I WOULD.

we've been ordering from these guys for a few months now, 1-2 times per week, and paying a premium price to have them bring us food with no issues, except that we were paying $20-$30 extra to have our food delivered.

Then as we ordered over $80 worth of food tonight as we had done on a regular basis, paid for it, and were waiting to have dinner delivered to us and our guests, we were called by the owner Dumont... who told me that he could no longer continue delivering to us because his employees were quitting on him and while he could run the food up himself to do what a real business owner does, he just wouldn't do it.... not for any price.


EVEN WORSE.... not only could he no longer continue delivering to us, but he was not even going to bring us our food that we already paid over $80 for.... when I asked him what I was supposed to do with the $80 worth of food we already paid for and was ready to be picked up, he told me it wasn't his problem.


he said i could meet him 15 minutes from my house to pick it up, basically right next door to the restaurant, to which I replied, 

""we have guests over, we've been drinking and that's why we ordered from you to have it delivered""

still he told me it's not his problem. 

when I called the restaurant to tell them we're having 1 of our guests come down to pick it up, the restaurant owner replied

""oh, i'm so mad at restaurant runners, we're not using them anymore""


If I were a restaurant I couldn't imagine using them and having them make my restaurant look bad either!",1
"We ordered from a local restaurant through the Restaurant Runners website. It arrived but was missing items. So my wife called to get resolution. The man who answered the phone at first said he could not help us because we did not order from the site. When we said we did and we had an email confirming the items ordered. He then offered to redeliver those or refund those.

I picked up and identified myself and explained that his resolution was fair, but that did not fix the bad experience for us. I started to say if he delivered the rest of the food I would have a cold meal... He cut me off and started ranting that Restaurant Runners is ""just a delivery service"" and it was the restaurants fault. I had to ask him to speak civilly to me.

I then explained that if I waited for the rest of the food my first delivery would be cold. Then I went on to explain that the real issue was the experience and that so far I was extremely displeased with the way he was handling the situation. I asked him to identify himself. He said his name was Jamon and he was the owner.

He then proceeded to tell me again how his company was not responsible until I asked him who I paid. The payee for my charge was Restaurant Runners. At that point he asked me what I wanted and I said, ""how about a $20 credit for my next order."" He put me on hold to check my order amount and agreed to refund $20 to my credit card. 

The experience was thoroughly unpleasant and he clearly did not understand customer service. I was trying to help by explaining that as a middleman he was taking responsibility for customer satisfaction. I should not have had to argue at all. I thought the affair was over and vowed not to order from this unpleasant man again. Then we got another call.

The restaurant called to apologize. They offered a refund or redelivery and apologized profusely. Ah, real customer service at last. With a little prying we found out that Jamon had called them 3 times during the past hour leaving messages and demanding $25 be paid to Restaurant Runners. Unbelievable that he would demand that from the restaurant plus $5 for what? His time?

Restaurant Runners is a small business in Boulder, CO. While I wholeheartedly endorse local business I cannot recommend this company at all. Jamon as the owner represents the entire company and clearly demonstrated his perception of service and his company's responsibility (or lack thereof) to the customer.

This service may have been good once, but if you want your meal experience to be a good one find someone else to deliver your food.",1
"It has potential...

Came here with friends for some drinks on a Friday night. A very random location, tucked away in between the 75 State Street building and the Banknorth on Broad Street.

I was severely disappointed when I walked into the bar and found myself in a dark, empty room with overpriced drinks, slow service, and a lame atmosphere.

However, I was pleasantly surprised when we started to move upstairs...several flights. This place just kept going up and up with random rooms coming off the stairwell/hallway as we moved higher--felt like I was in a Saloon looking for my favorite prosti-tot.

Anyway, made it upstairs to the roof-deck which was great! Pretty much the only reason I liked this place. It gets two stars, merely for the roof deck. 

Other than that, I hated this place. The service was WICKED slow. The bartenders ignored the order people came up to the bar and in addition, when I was the only one in line, it took them 10 minutes to get me a Bud Light while 3 of them figured out how to reload paper into the cash register. And the people there were annoying. I was with a gay friend of mine who was visiting from Ohio and some annoying girls kept making comments like ""OMG can we go SHOPPING!?"" because they figure we want to be their best friends...sorry hun, I'm not impressed by someone who finds it funny to sleep with married men. Snooty attitudes and pretentious snobs kept me in my circle of friends...not a place where I'd like to mingle.

Overall, it has potential. Let's slash the prices or learn how to make a good mixed drink. Fix the service and I'll bump you up a star or two. And then lose the 'god's gift' attitude found mostly in gay clubs and maybe you'll get another.",2
"GAH! This place has potential..but there is something about it that makes me feel ""meh"" towards it. The drinks were expensive..though my cosmo was actually really good...the bar downstairs was completely empty and the rooftop deck was filled with weird men and the girls that ...like..weird..men?? lol...The atmosphere seemed awkward and as I was standing at the roof bar with my party, some random guy that had been staring at me the whole time I was there brushed up against me and felt the need to pull on my shirt...weirdo. Anyways..it has a lot of potential..I just wish whoever is running it would figure that out and create some sort of order and vibe here...It seems lost in the wind with no personality.",2
"Meh.

That sums up how I feel about this place.  I've been here a few times for various things either after work or on a Saturday night.  I don't like it first of all because it touches the building I work in and on a non work day the last thing I want to see is my building.

I love Magner's and got excited when I realized they had it on tap, so of course I order up a round of two blue moons for my boyfriend and a friend and a Magner's for me.  All are poured terribly and I had to ask the bartender to pour one again cause it was like 1 inch of beer and 5 inches of head.  Bartenders gives me a sigh and mean look and does as I asked.

I have some more Magner's and order some more and all are not very cold and heady.  Meh.  Saturday was a beautiful night and like many other times I've gone there the roofdeck was closed even though the weather was great.

The only saving grace of this place is that is attached to another bar called Aqua which if you go through the employees only door on the first floor near the bathroom you go to with no cover and no line.  Not like Aqua had a cover or line that night but whatever.

Aqua is a better bar with fresher Magner's.  They played better music and even had a tiny dancefloor.  Not my favorite but still ok...",2
"this is part one of a four part series entitled ""the worst tour"".  to preface the story, it was a buddy of ours birthday and he was expecting us to take him to mars for dinner and then maybe some wine at san jose.  as a joke, we had coordinated every one to meet at bennigans and start ""the worst tour"".  the others in the tour were hooters, tgi fridays, and the coyote ugly.  jake was pissed for some time and didn't cheer up until we got a cold pbr in his hands at jackelope.  
lets get this story started.   they didn't have the bennigan's on riverside listed, but i doubt it makes much difference.  they all suck on the same level so location is not important.  our friends were waiting on us and our server promptly asked us who was responsible for making everyone wait and that they should pay.  he was kidding, but just started out wrong.  they did have firemans on tap, so that has to count for something.  looking around, i couldn't figure out how this place stayed in business.  have dozen tables at eight on a saturday?  open menu.  i haven't been proved wrong yet, but if you have to put a picture of your food on the menu, then its junk.  the service continued to decline.  our waiter kept hovering and dropping in on our conversation.  it was one of the oddest and rudest things i have ever seen.  granted, this guy was probably bored stiff as we were on of his two tables, but back off!!!  he only got worse.  we then noticed that he refused to set drings/orders down on the table.  he would make each person take then from him.  drinks, appetizers, even a fucking hot plate of fajitas for friends of ours.  he would stand in one spot and make each person reach across the table to grab their stuff.  and this was a round table in the middle of the room, so access was not a problem.
the food.  just what we expected. bad.  
we got out as quick as possible.  now i got exactly what i deserved by going to this type of place and i felt guilty spending money on it.  it only cements my dislike for these type of establishments.  every part of my experience there was sub par but the service was what made it unbearable.  i have waited tables in the past and believe that service can make even a shitty place bearable.  our guy was just salt in the wound.  

off to the next stop on ""the worst tour"".....................................",1
"I don't eat deep fried chain restaurant food, but I do know that Social M. has 20 reviews for Bennigan's all over the US.  Perhaps Social M. did a Bennigan's tour?  Anyway, one star because you have to give one, and another star for having Absolut Pear Vodka for me to drink while waiting at a hotel on a business trip like 3 years ago... yeah, Bennigan's, while not being that good or healthy, has a pretty extensive bar.  Weird.  Must need to keep all that Jack Daniel's stocked for the JD menu section.",2
"Well I have to make an admission, even though I get paid by certain magazines to write about brilliant food and cooking and great dining I have to admit I am a fan of TGI Fridays and all it's mediocrity.  Bennigan's I was told was another form of the awful corporate American interstate diner, but unfortunately for Bennigan's just couldn't compete with the complete mediocre TGI Fridays.

The location is decent, located right of 35 on one of those ridiculous frontage roads we have in Texas (whose stupid idea are those things anyway?).  The decor is as you would expect, typical corporate crap, it all runs on the ""let's decorate as cheaply as we can"" theory.

The Monte Cristo I was told was the ""Signature"" item and if that is their signature, well they need to learn how to write a little better because the Monte Cristo was the closest thing to inedible I have had in a very long time.  The flavor profiles were all over the map and overall it was just a horrendous meal.  The presentation was poor at best and the food was not worth what I paid.

Service was mediocre, nothing to bad but also nothing to really highlight.  Overall this place is just another corporate place to get crappy food while being served by pissed off high school kids who's moms made them get jobs.",2
"Everyone else has hit the nail on the head for this place.  Unfortunately, it is exactly what you would expect -- non-descript food, poor waitstaff, outdated interior.  I have a rule that if I don't like some place after going 2 times, it's sayonara.  Sorry, Bennigan's, but we're through.  It hasn't been complain-to-the-manager bad, just not good or remarkable or interesting.  There's plenty of other restaurants in this same area, so keep going past Bennigan's.",2
"If you think this is going to be ANYTHING like the wonderful Omeletrry in Austin, TX, think again. The migas, breakfast tacos, quesadillas -- and everything else on the ""south of the border"" menu --are close to inedible. Canned green beans in a quesadilla? This is Tex-Mex cooked by someone who has apparently never TASTED Tex-Mex. Run. Run fast. Ex-Texans should head to La Taqueria in Union Square if they want to remember what Mexican food tastes like.",1
"Bad experience this past summer:  Eggs over-cooked, bacon under-cooked (despite asking for well done), pancake overcooked. Stay away! Oh, did I mention that the A/C was inadequate (even though it was only 75 degrees outside). Mom and Dad better get up here from Austin and protect their investment, before it's too late.",1
"I have been going to Munch with my wife and two sons for just over a year.  It was quite good then, but lately its taken a turn for the worse.  Hopefully it will turn again because the concept is quite good.

The focus is on children, yet the grazing plate we ordered was two microwaved meatballs, a slice of process cheese, tiny bits of  strawberries and canned pineaapple and a couple of rice crackers.  Contrast this from a year ago, the same plate was procuitto, chunks of cheese, grapes and proper crackers - very substantial and healthy.  

The adults menu consists of a four salads and some heavy meat dishes involving sirloin or roast chicken.  Quite heavy choices for summertime.  The salads were mechanically impressive, stacked high, beautiful presentation, but they lacked taste.

Service was OK.  The usual waitress is a nervous talker and requests additions to our meals - much like they do at Red Lobster.  Wine or cocktails are always suggested.  We do enjoy them but felt a bit of a hard sell on the alcohol too.

The facilites are great if you have children, the equipment is fantastic for toddlers and young children.  Music is tasteful, the decor is nice, the facilities were clean, although they are sometimes out of paper towels.

If the menu turns around again, I might go back.",2
"Really slow service lately. Dirty bathrooms and food is way too overpriced. The kids menu is weak, no real flavour or creativity.",2
"This place has admitted to using unpaid, job hopefuls to fill shifts. They are currently under investigation.

"My experience at Munch can be summed up as follows:  terrible service and overpriced food.  We went to Munch on a Saturday afternoon to try out lunch after hearing about this neat restaurant concept.  

The menu given to us was a brunch menu.  When we asked whether there was a lunch menu, the waitress CURTLY told us that they were only serving brunch and walked away.  Since we had eaten brunch-like items earlier that morning, we decided to leave. Only when she saw us leaving did she say that it was not possible to make lunch items until 1pm because the kitchen wasn't set up for lunch yet.  It was 12:35pm at the time.  What restaurant does not serve lunch at noon?  Maybe they need to reconsider how they operate the business.  The waitress said that it wouldn't be fair to offer us lunch items when other customers didn't have that option.  She did say that she could maybe persuade the kitchen to make the kids' lunch earlier and that we could place our orders in at 1pm.  Against our better judgement, we stayed and ordered.  The lunch was fair at best in my opinion.  I had a bison burger and the bun was toasted to the point it was hard and my burger patty was dry.  For what they were charging and for the attitude the waitress had, I'd much rather go anywhere else but there.",1
"Babyeats has changed their name to ""munch! the family restaurant.""  

We stopped in for lunch today with 2 kids in tow.  We ordered an appetizer and 4 entrees.  Everything that came was good but 2 of our orders never came.  We asked our server about the food 3 times and we were told that it was coming.  It never arrived.

When everyone else was done eating we decided to cut our losses and leave.  We ended up paying $40 dollars for our 2 kids to eat and for an appetizer.  I had to ask the server to remove the food that never came from the bill.  The stupidest part was that the orders that never came were both  soup of the day.  How could they not manage to ladle some soup into a bowl in the hour that we were there for?",1
"Miss D. and I came here twice for burger meals on a large gift card.  Burgers are fine, but both times we came, we had very new waiters, who were friendly and apologetic for their minor screw-ups and delays (and we love you for it, really!), but service overall was bewildered and inefficient.  My guess is that they faced the ""sink or swim"" option very quickly after hire and weren't trained well.  For this I blame management. I was no more impressed with my two meals at the Decatur location a few years back.

Also, the valet in the mostly empty parking lot on a Wednesday night (between Christmas and New Year's when it seems everyone has left town)  mystified me.  I voluntarily valet only when space is limited or walk is long.  Otherwise, I can park my car myself, thank you very much. He steered me to a non-pay/non-tip space.  When we left an hour later, he was gone.  Must have been too slow a night.",2
"This particular location has consistently disappointed me. I even had to call the District manager once. He promised me some vouchers which I never received, and when I called back to follow up there was miraculously no record of my call or my complaint!

I ended up here yesterday though and it was a pretty good experience. I think it was only because it was the middle of the day and the place was almost empty. I give this place a VERY generous C-",2
Blech! All their food tastes the same and they balk at the idea of swapping items in their lunch specials. The only pros are the nice view and the quick service.,2
"After passing by Eastern Pier hundreds of times while working in the area, I decided I would do take-out while staying at the nearby Seaport Hotel (take-out options are still somewhat scarce in Boston's up-and-coming Seaport District).  I didn't sit down, but as others have noted, then ambiance is basic, unless you grab a table on the harborside deck (visible from the front desk).

I can't comment much more on the ambiance or the service (though I find $10 credit-card minimums a tedious anachronism these days), but I can tell you that I endured the single worst serving of chow foon I have ever encountered.  I ordered Pepper Steak chow foon... which was probably my mistake.  Chow foon is typically a dry-stir-fried dish with a deep, seared flavor and very little sauce.  This was a snotty, Cantonese-style concoction with a thick, slightly sweet, starch sauce and an overwhelming amount of green pepper.  

Maybe I chose poorly, but yuck, a tragic waste of calories.",1
"Terrible experience at Smile Thai Cafe. It was so cold in the restaurant  that people were wearing their coats and hats. It was warmer outside in the stairwell. 

When the manager and waitstaff were told - as if they didn't know already - how cold it was, they said someone was working on it, and walked away. 

Clearly they knew about this, but just kept seating people anyway, trying to make a buck.  It was so cold that people couldn't pick up their utensils.",1
I don't think this restaurant is good.  I ordered dinner combo but the main dishes were not good at all.  It was fried vegetables but the vegetables are almost uncooked.  Taste itself is not so bad; however I don't like the way they cook.  Green curry that my friend ordered was also same uncooked vegi!,1
"maybe it was the build-up of one of my friends who probably has never had good thai food, but I was mad disappointed.  The food did not seem fresh or particularly good.  Def. not recommended.  I have yet to have good thai or even good chinese in cambridge, but at least pepper sky is better than smile.",2
"Yes, the prices are lower than other Thai restaurants in Harvard Square, considering you get a soup, salad, appetizer, entree combination for $10.95 at dinner. That said, the salad isn't good. The appetizer, soup, and entree are small, and the wait staff is kind of rude. It tastes pretty good, but don't think about coming here in fall/winter if you want to be comfortable. They don't heat the restaurant adequately. I'd say it's 64-66 in there. Not the most pleasant for eating out.",2
"My husband and I used to go here quite a bit for cheap, tasty thai food. Unfortunately, they are now under new owners and their food isn't good anymore. It's lost its yumminess -- the tom yum soup is 'gray water' as opposed to a flavorful broth, and my pineapple and shrimp dish was boring.

If you're looking for thai food in Harvard Square, I recommend 9 Tastes instead.",1
"Smile Thai --- RiP.  My wife and I also used to get dinner at Smile Thai, it was cheep, flavorful, and quick.  However, the quality went downhill a few months ago (apparent management change) and now the name of the establishment has become ""Aiyara.""  The service was still friendly and quick, but the food was very poor.  The yellow curry had no flavor, my ""Shrimp and Pineapple Delight"" curry was 6 shrimp and about 30 canned pineapple chunks.  Both of our dishes came out lukewarm and my shrimp were very undercooked.  With a decline in quality the establishment has increased in price.  Two dishes, with appetizer and one soda came to $40.
We really miss the old Smile Thai.",1
"Food is decent, price is ok, but had the worst experience ever with the waitress.  My girlfriend went there a couple days before and tipped 15% because the service is mediocre as always.  That day I went in and we ordered our food and a Thai Iced Tea.  It came out half full.  When we questioned why it was like that, another waiter asked our waitress only to tell us that she did so because she didn't like the tip my girlfriend left last time.  I was astonished to hear such a thing.  Never have I heard a complaint about an average tip for mediocre service, and then get treated in that way.  Needless to say, we asked for the manager and nothing was done about it.  Enough said.",1
"Yuck
Got take out. They forgot the peanut sauce both times.
 the Rad-NA is nah-sty.",1
"The worst waitress experience ever!  My friend and I got the dinner special (split it).  We got the pad see you with scallion pancake and tofu veg. soup.  I was disappointed with the pancake since it was clearly leftover pancake that had been deep fried (ewww), so I ordered a whole new one, which was fresh and yummy.  Was it left over from someone's plate?  Why was it deep fried?  I didn't appreciate the their tired leftovers being passed off in the dinner special.   Having to order a separate order significantly added to our bill as the pancake is the most pricy one that I've found in the city.

The waitress was down right rude.  The pad see you came with no protein.   Granted, my friend forgot to mention that that was was what she wanted (tofu), but the waitress should have asked during the ordering process as the dish comes with chicken tofu, etc. since it is supposed to come with a choice of protein.

I asked the waitress if  she could bring us out some tofu.  She brought out raw, cold chunks and slid it on to the table with a scowl on her face.  With that, after she brought the bill, she hovered.  I asked if we could have some money removed from the bill since the dish hadn't come as it was supposed to.  The tofu was in an inedible state.  She says no, and yells that ""I brought out the tofu"".  she goes on to point out that there was not hing else wrong with the meal, etc. etc. At this point.  As her voice is going up in volume, also am saying Okay, okay, OKAY!!!!! Since she won't stop yelling even though I've already agreed to pay the bill (just because I don't want to continue arguing with someone who is so unpleasant).  I was so aggravated for the rest of the night.  It totally wasn't worth it.",1
"I walked here all the way from my dorm in Cambridge once after seeing that it got great reviews on Chowhound. I wasn't very impressed with anything but the dessert, but the people seemed very nice, and this is the kind of restaurant you hope succeeds. My soup was ordinary. My falafel sandwich was worse than average. The falafel was mealy, dry, and bland. I would rank it lower than Moody's, Reef, Rami's, C'est Bon, Algiers, Barada...you get the picture. The walk was pleasant though!",2
"This place is super-popular at lunchtime and the only reason why is that there are few other choices in the area.   

While breakfast is pretty good, I think its overpriced and the portions are small.  They also commit the cardinal sin of making you get your own coffee from vacuum pump containers (that don't keep the coffee hot).  How hard is it for a waiter/tress to pour hot coffee at regular intervals?  really?

We also have been there for lunch and had perhaps the worst pasta ever. It took forever, probably because they were waiting for the pasta to reach the right completely gummy soft gross consistency.  Seriously, it was inedible.  

I had the fish tacos which were kind of strange, but pretty good.  I would actually order that again if I had to go here.   Other sandwiches looked decent, but, again, they are pretty expensive for what it is and where it is.   Oak Hill can do better.

They have a nice outdoor patio out in the busy parking lot.  Be prepared for mega cigarette smoke.",2
"First of all, I have to say this is one of my father-in-law's favorite places to eat so I may be a little biased (unfavorably) about this place!  We generally do not agree about restaurants.  
However, how is it possible to get bad onion breath from a wrap that was totally flavorless?  I ordered the chicken wrap that was supposed to have guacamole, but the waitress informed me they were all out of guacamole. Yet, when she brought out my wrap, I noticed that there was avacado on it.  Now, isn't avocado the main component of guacamole?  Why couldn't they whip some up?  It might have slightly improved the dull, dry, blah chicken but I doubt it!  My husband got bread pudding for dessert (one of his favorite desserts) and he said it tasted exactly like pine-sol. That's never a good thing when it comes to food! Although, I don't believe he has ever actually tasted pine-sol, I knew what he meant. I might give this place one more try for breakfast because I've heard that it's good here.",2
"Not too crazy about the food, but I love the ambiance.  It's cute and cozy, staff is nice.  I'm trying to remember what I even ate here.  The menu is a book so there are plenty of options.",2
"I believe this business is closed.  The lights are off, chairs are stacked on the table and there is a note on the door that I have not read. . .always in my car when I drive by, and do not want to miss light in my attempt to race out and read it. . . I""m so curious like that.",1
"Yeah... this place wasn't very good.  We went for ""Ladies Night"" a few weeks ago and sat at the bar drinking mojito's for a half hour until a table opened up.  

The food was free so I really shouldn't complain, but I'll just say it was like eating in a cafeteria.  It was edible.  A sad caprice salad, an interesting chicken fettuccine dish and a cake dessert that was still a bit frozen in the middle.  When the bill came I only owed $9 for the three course meal so again, I shouldn't complain.

Afterward, we were all going to go to District but the mojito's we drank were so sweet that I knew that if I went dancing I'd end up losing my free dinner all over the dance floor.  So, I cabbed it home.  We did see Paul Pierce on the way out of News.. so that's something, right?",2
"MUST HAVE MASS ID FOR ALCOHOL!!!
I will show very little appreciation for the Free Ladies night dinner on Wednesday.  Luckily for me I do eat very small portions, which is all that you get.  Others reviewed that the food made them sick.  Mine was getting cold, but tolerable (certainly better off paying for food elsewhere).  

I thought that I would give the ladies night a second shot before I cross it off my list forever.  My second trip in I was told that they no longer accept out-of-state licences for alcohol (this was about a month ago).   I'd be willing to give this place a shot on another night of the week... but apparently my out-of-state money is not good enough for them.",2
"Great raspberry mojito- it's made with fresh raspberries and fresh mint. 

Snooty door attitude. What kind of place bills itself as a diner (Hojo's gone metrosexual) and gets snippy at the door because one person is wearing sandals? They need to figure out their branding. 

Food was decent. Too bad they were out of the first choices for my friends- 2 diff kinds of french toast and crepes. How are you out of those? I had steak and eggs and was worried that they might run out of eggs.",1
"Apparently nothing is free. 

Beware the News ""Free Ladies Night Dinner."" First of all, the food is completely weak. They don't print prices on the menu so after a pathetic meal of a limp cesaer salad, pasta with broccoli, mushrooms and red sauce and a single chocolate chip cookie the total ends up at 26.00...which you are required to pay 18% gratuity on. Most people can make better food at home. 
And definitely don't buy into the ""free valet parking"" as advertised on the website. According to the manager ""it's a misprint, it hasn't been updated."" Okay, so now you know Mr. Manager...update it! So parking will cost you $5. 
Plus, if you hadn't guessed, the wait for Ladies Night is ridiculous, easily an hour and a half to get seated. And the whole time you'll be oogled and leered at. 

If you want a night out with no choices over the bad food you eat, which will still cost you money and force you to be surrounded by creepies...this is definitely your place. If not, I advice you go elsewhere.

That said, other nights at News can be fun and I like the loungy atmosphere. Definitely get props for being open so late, and normally the meals are better quality with better service than on ladies night. But that evening really ruined it for me.",2
"News is off my list.  Here's what happened on Wednesday's Ladies Night:

1. the advertised Free Valet Parking was really $5.  
2. I held up the cocktail menu and asked the waitress if these were included in the ""rush hour"" $5 drink menu.  She said yes.  Then when I ordered my drink she told me it was actually $9.  Only rum and coke is $5.  sweeeeet. 
3. the $2 appetizers include 2 pieces of whatever you ordered.
4. others in my party complained about portion size.  i can deal, but the salad consisted of 3 pieces of lettuce and 2 croutons (though they were 3 tasty bites)
5. every single entree was in varying stages of being cold. the fish was not cooked thoroughly (not like seared tuna, more like still swimming) and later that night one friend was physically ill though she avoided the super raw parts. 
6. the description of my dish was: scrumptious grouper with mashed potatoes and broccoli. my dish literally, and i mean literally, had ONE floret of broccoli. i was stupefied. 
7. at the end of our ""free"" meal we were left with a FIFTY dollar bill - our 'gratuity' fee. Gratuity? We thought maybe it was a joke. 

So, If you go to News avoid Wednesday nights because your free meal could cost about 20 per person and when it's for food you would send back to the kitchen, or just walk out on, it is not worth it.  Also, $9 drinks? I know Boston is expensive but the owner has six other area restaurants, so couldn't he cut us a break?",1
"""Skeezahs"" come from suburbs far and wide to enjoy the delectable treats of Ladies Night on Wednesday....Ladies, by the time you pay for drinks, parking, and by the time the restaurant ""accidentaly"" charges you for dessert, you end up paying what you would pay anywhere else.

Food (and ESPECIALLY service) is totally hit or miss....Sandwich/fry combos can be great or that $15 tuna melt/chip combo can make you reminisce about lunchtime at JFK elementary school....Been here a few of times, I keep asking myself why.",2
"BAD NEWS
Went to News last night after hitting a few clubs in town. This might be one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.  The waitress didn't speak a lick of English and screwed up the order. Asked for Eggs Benedict, runny, they came out hard as two rocks. The waitress called over an English speaking gentleman who assured me that the eggs would be re-cooked and that News offered Corned beef hash. After ordering a side of hash I wasn't surprised to see my plate returned with 2 poached eggs even harder than the first set and a corned beef sandwich!
Oh don't let me forget the biggest gaff of all, the FAKE LINE OUTSIDE! That's right, waited a half hour and when we got inside there was no one in there! We sat right down at one of many empty  available seats. The owner must be really hard up because everything is overpriced and over-rated.  I would NOT recommend this place to my worst enemy!",1
"News is somewhat out of place in Chinatown (Ok, technically it's the Leather District, but you still feel like its Chinatown) and some things seem to be out of place in the management here as well. I think their imagined identity, clientele, and the type of people News attracts aren't in sync.

They have a cool leather-couch lounge/dinner/bar type feel, but the atmosphere here was knocked down heavily by the odd selection of music they insisted on playing: Metallica, Pink Floyd, etc. ?? Seriously, some sort of non-distracting lounge/chillout music with a beat or a groove would have been much more cohesive to the overall look/feel.

edit: No loss that this place closed.",2
"I went to this place on Sat night around 10:30pm with some friends.  The place was empty.  I know its more of a late night spot, but still. Our poor waitress.  My friend asked her what beer they had on tap and she named a few, none of which interested me.  So I asked her what they had in bottles....which was clearly too difficult of a question.  She named 3...then paused, and tried again.  She named the same three but still couldn't come up with anymore.  She apologized and said she would be right back.  She asked at the bar, and came back with a list of like 6 beers.  We all ordered and she came back with our drinks.  My friend had to send his guiness back because the pour was awful.  Another friend of mine ordered a sam winter, which tasted really bad.  He decided to go up to the bar to deal with it because it clearly wasn't going well with the waitress.  The bartender apologized, and said that he had told the waitresses that that beer's tap wasn't working properly.  She forgot to pass the message along to us.  While he was at the bar, he found out there were about 6 bottled beer choices that she wasn't able to remember (at this point I kinda felt bad for her).  We finished our drink and left for a more lively bar with better service!",2
"My friends and I wandered into News on a Wednesday night after attending a function in the neighborhood. Having skipped the free congealed pizza at the function, we set off to find a decent restaurant on our way back to South Station. In hindsight, we should have stuck with the free pizza.

When we entered News, we were informed that it was Ladies Night, and with the prospect of free dinner dangled in front of us, our cheap little hearts leapt at the thought of getting something for nothing. It was a bit off putting that we were asked (nicely) to please go drink at the bar while waiting for our table, which we planned on doing anyway. Our girly martinis seemed heavy on the sweet and low on the alcohol, so we spent most of our 90 minute wait trying to see what the other girls (there wasn't a man to be found in the place) were eating and which table would finish first. By the time we sat down to our small portions of caesar salad, chicken parm, and a practically see through slice of cheesecake, we had been there for over 2 hours. As other reviewers mentioned, the food was pretty lackluster (cafeteria type stuff), and not particularly warm. 

The feeling I got from News was that they are trying to be an upscale, trendy lounge, but with the cheesy Ladies Night promotion, it just doesn't work. That Wednesday was one of the strangest I had spent in awhile, and anytime that I leave a bar/restaurant still hungry and sober, it is going to earn two stars from me.",2
"I am rating this one solely on it's ""ladies night"" experience.  This one was a staple for a while during our weekly ladies night romps.  At first we were thrilled with the free (yes, FREE) three course meal for ladies.  The raspberry mojitos are phenomenal, the leather couches to sit and gossip in are luxurious, but the food and service eventually let us down.  I don't want to give up on the place entirely (especially since it was free) but I think it got a little lazy about showing the girls a good time.",2
"Ok Ladies Night ummm yeah. The company was awesome. I'm not to keen on paying $10 for a pina colada, or waiting over half an hour for a table. The whole go to the bar and drink up thing just doesn't really work for me. 

The vibe was weird, Get Low, and candle light. I felt like there should be a dance floor somewhere, and wasn't really able to relax as there were screaming ladies sitting behind us. Not a big deal as it is a bar and lounge, but the ambience didn't call for that kind of behavior even if the music did. 

Service? Adequate, barely. Our waitress who got the tip did barely any work and the guys just ran her food. I don't feel like she earned what she got personally and you know she's not going to be tipping out a whole lot. Our plates were just set down in front of us and we had just barely taken a nibble when she was like ""how is everything?"" Any good server knows you wait a few (like 3-4) before coming over and asking how things are. I had the steak tips, the fries were ok, the meat was cooked well but seemed to lose flavor after the inital couple of bites. And a chocolate chip cookie for dessert . . . LAME! 

Nothing about this place makes me want to come back, though I might try it on a different night. But the meals were free, and $15 wasn't bad for 3 gals.",2
"For awhile I've been hearing about their Wednesday three course dinner special for the ladies and wondered how and why.  After going last night I realized why.  With all the attitude problems of the staff here, they're probably having problems with people returning.

Now I'm not going to say everyone had attitude problems.  It was just the women.  Somehow the group I was with was yelled at by the ""hostess"" (I use that term loosely) because of a mistake the waiter made.  The men staff there didn't have an attitude but I'm pretty sure it's because they weren't intelligent enough to cop an attitude.  And honestly, the food wasn't so great to warrant a staff with attitude.  It wasn't horrible, but not great either.

I've been here once before and received the same attitude problem.  Honestly, this is a dinky little place outside South Station.  I hate when dumps try to act all NY or LA.

Not to totally discredit this place, since there is one good aspect (both times I went).  The bartender was pretty cool and funny.  If you go at any time, make sure to sit by the bar so you can deal with him directly.  He's the only saving grace for this place and for that I give it a second star.  Once he's gone, the star disappears.",2
"Went here tonight for Ladies Night.... and I can't really complain too much about a 3 course meal, tip, tax, and coffee for $14 - but then again - it wasn't that great. I had the steak tips, they were OK, but not the best things in the world.

The service was really slow, and they make you wait for forever to get your table. I know the thought process behind this is that you'll drink more while waiting for your your table, but I think that only works on larger parties. Besides, I would think the waiter/waitress would want the table to get sat faster so those drinks would go on their tab.

The scene there tonight was interesting. Nothing really matched. They had soft lighting and candles, like you'd find at a nicer restaurant, booty shakin music playing, and the Simpsons and then the Sox game on the TV. I could see this place being interesting after hours on a weekend night playing the type of music that they were playing tonight if they cleared out the tables, chairs, and couches.

They do offer a Valet service for $5 if you need it as well.

I wouldn't be opposed to checking this out another night to see how it is for a late night spot... but the ladies night was very lackluster.",2
"I went to News in October for dinner with some girl friends because Wednesday nights there are Ladies' Night - women get a 3-course meal for free!

We had been to News for a Ladies' Night once before and I remembered it being dark and not feeling great after. But it was about a year prior, so I figured I'd give it another shot.

No sickness after (yay!) and the food was actually quite good. The menu does leave a bit to be desired though:

There is no choice of appetizer - it was a Caesar salad (no anchovies) but they did at least let me get the dressing on the side.

The choices for main course were Chicken Parm with Linguine in a red sauce; Salmon (I think with mashed potatoes? I don't eat salmon, so I didn't even look); and Penne in a red sauce (I assume for vegetarians). I opted for the Chicken Parm, as then I got the pasta anyway! It was a decent size portion - not huge, but I devoured the entire thing and was full.

Dessert was a tasty piece of cheesecake.

I also had a Raspberry Mojito (I like regular, plain mojitos, but they didn't offer them and Raspberry sounded tasty). It was a big drink - served in a full-size water glass - and came with rock candy on a stick and raspberries floating at the bottom (unfortunately, I didn't get to them quick enough and was unable to eat them as they had gotten squished). When the drink came, my first thought was (that is one clear, weak drink). Boy, was I mistaken! This drink was fairly strong and may have been a large contributor to me cleaning off every plate of all 3 courses.

The restaurant was still quite dark and LOUD. My throat hurt when we left from talking so loud! As I said when we were there, ""It's Ladies' Night - there should be no music because we ladies chat chat chat!"" Plus, they were playing weird music - Korn and Rage Against the Machine and other stuff that didn't seem quite appropriate.

Two warnings: reservations mean nothing here, at least on Wednesdays. We had a 7:00 reservation and 1/2 my party checked in at 6:30. They gave them a number and said to sit at the bar. I got there just around 7 and was the last one. My friend talked to the hostess who said they would call us when a table was ready (more than 50% of the tables were empty) and to have a seat at the bar. I checked in 15 minutes later and she said the same thing - pushing the bar AGAIN but emphasizing that ""on Wednesdays, because of the free meal, we sort of do first come"" - all while TEXTING on her cell phone.

I was hostess, that is not appropriate to do at all, let alone while speaking to paying customer.

So I said ""look, we had a 7:00 reservation and 1/2 of us have been here since 6:30, at the bar."" She looked at the ""waiting list"" and said ""but no one wrote down that they were here at 6:30?"" My response ""apparently not."" 2 minutes later we had a table - one of the many empty ones.

The other warning is that the service (as evident by my hostess experience above) is not great. We asked for waters, never got them. And the waitress sort of ignored us a bit. I've had much worse service, and I understand that it's a free meal, but we all got drinks - some people got several - and still tipped on the food (it's automatically put on the bill).

So, I wouldn't necessarily recommend News on a regular basis, but if you're in the mood for a fun, free meal with your girl friends, take advantage!",2
"I went for ladies night and for a 3-course meal that was free, it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't the best thing ever. I ordered the salmon, which was a little dry, but the mashed potatoes were good.
The wait was really long especially since there were empty tables all over the place! Drinks were very pricey...$10 for a Pina Colada...yeah, it was good, but not that good! The music was alright, but it was more club type stuff so it really wasn't very quiet and I felt like I was shouting the whole time, so if you're looking for a place to sit down and chat, this isn't the place.",2
"eh....it's a bar/restaurant.  nothing really special.  drink menu did not have prices so a friend and i paid $15 for a specialty martini + bottled beer.  free salty snacks at the bar.  wasn't too busy at 11 on a saturday night until the spillover from the party i was trying to get to nearby settled here.  nothing really exciting to draw me back, lil out of the way to get to by T.",2
"Alert!!! This place is NOT teriyaki heaven. I got the spicy soup. i think the chicken was bad. the shrimp was also a little ripe. the beef was tough, but alright. i don't like to complain so i ate most of it and didn't touch the chicken pieces. the broth was sort of featureless. the dude was nice. place is always empty. now i know why.",1
"I thought id give this place a chance, because it was close toIf you like video poker, this place is for you. At 6pm on a monday there was six times as many people there for video poker than to eat. Decor is shoddy, and not tasteful. Needs update bad. Prices were high for the quality of food you get. The good thing is they dont use msg, but with food this boring it sure could use some. My advise, go to the mongolian buffet across the street.  You get more bang for your buck.",2
"Eh Had the spicy noodle soup- it was HUGE and contained beef, chicken and shrimp.  The beef tasted very old... the chicken and shrimp were okay.  I won't be going back.",2
This is the most HORRIBLE restaurant I have ever been to. The food is disgusting. My boyfriend and I were so disappointed and dissatisfied. The lady I dealt with was unpleasant to speak to. She was so stuck to her word. I told her I would leave a bad review and she refunded me right away. I also brought up that she has horrible reviews on here. Quite frankly this is by far the WORST Chinese food place I have ever been to. My boyfriend and I are crazy about Chinese food but this was flat or disgusting. Please save your money to and go to the next Chinese restaurant. Even if it's a little ways out. Don't be like us and settle for the nearest Chinese place. And read reviews. DO NOT GO HERE.,1
"It's difficult and painful for an east coast jewish girl to feel this blah and unemotional about chinese food. Makes me sad. And I really hate giving only one star. I just feel mean. But as I drove home last night from a fairly disappointing date (my first in over a year), I was hungry. So I decided that the I would turn it around by trying somewhere new. So I stopped at this place since I had driven by so very many times. 

I didn't think this place was straight out chinese.. I thought it was a teriyaki place. I guess I was wrong. I assumed prices would be quite cheap because of the bare bones appearance. It's big, bright (too bright), and there were many table and booths. No one was there (one couple came in for pick up) - so perhaps I should have stopped there for pause.

I got a general gau's chicken. It came with rice. It cost $8. I drove home, excited for kitty cuddles, scrabble and chinese food. It was the worst chinese food I have had in portland, maybe anywhere. Not one vegetable in the mix, the chicken pieces were cut in shapes we don't usually see them. The sauce was sweet but it had a weird, bitter taste to it. I was buzzed and hungry and I ate the whole thing. And this morning I find myself quite sorry.",1
"Pretty disappointing. I frequent a lot of teriyaki places, and i base their quality on 2 things. Portion size and taste.

While I'd give the taste here an above average rating(chicken breast, cooked to order, well charred), the portion of chicken was so small i left hungry. For about $7 for a plate, I expected to be fed.

The place itself was pretty dumpy, but that was expected considering the location thus not factored into the review.",2
"I CANNOT put into words how disappointing this place is.  So it's Friday night, my lady and I wanted to try it because we drive by it all the time, so we order a big meal on Friday only to try it at home and it tastes like Monday's leftovers.  I could have started a fire by rubbing chicken pieces together.  The only reason this place exists is because of the gaming machines, which I didn't play because the closet they keep them in smells like piss and loss.  The only way I'd ever go there again is if you drag my dead body.",1
"Very disappointed with our meal tonight- food did not taste fresh, the chicken and pork were really dry and the egg rolls were completely inedible. I hope we just caught them on a bad day but I won't be back to find out. I'm surprised a restaurant this bad is still in business especially with all of the great food in Portland.",1
"I ordered a variety of things (but not the sushi) from Tokyo City through http://www.campusfood.com. I'm pretty much in alignment with Toro E. Certainly the food is tolerable. I had to think for a second about whether it's better than that, but the answer is no. I'm reluctantly giving a third star because of the fair pricing and the solid delivery. Also, I think this might be a place where you can find something they really do well and stick to it. The ingredients seemed decent enough...

For much better Japanese delivery, try Takemura in Harvard Square. It's more expensive, however. For better Japanese food in a similar price range to Tokyo City, try Ittyo in the Porter Exchange.

(second thought: nah, I can't give three stars.)",2
"In one word: eh.

We went for the $5.95 lunch special, which is just too low of a price to pass up. In exchange, we chose from five columns of five choices, which even worked out for my vegetarian girlfriend, and got miso soup as well. Unfortunately, the food is just not good: the miso soup was watery and bland, the vegetables tasted sour as if the sauce had gone bad, the tempura sauce lacked daikon, the pork croquette did NOT actually contain pork, and seaweed salad (the worst offense) was NOT a seaweed salad. Instead, it was a regular salad topped with a few bits of seaweed. The one food item that did taste fairly good, though, was the braised beef and vegetables. However, that didn't do enough to save the meal, and I didn't even bother getting the lunch card (buy five lunches get one free), as I knew I wouldn't be back.

As for other parts of the restaurant, the ambience was awful with rundown decor and few clients. However, the service was at least fast and attentive.",2
"I have found Curry Leaf has some of the best tasting Indian food in the Natick/Framingham area. That said, they have some of the most unpleasant and rude service I've ever encountered. They will almost never bother to say hello or good bye, they will never ask you how your meal is, and worst of all, they will hardly ever check to see if you need a refill on your water (which is particularly needed for spicy Indian food). I've had to find the water pitcher myself while the waitstaff is clustered around a laptop surfing the web in the front of the restaurant. I'll think twice about revisiting despite their above average food.",2
"BAD PLACE~ I just ate here a week ago & got food poisoning.  It is nasty, dark and the place is terrible.  The music was so loud (at 4:00 PM) that I couldn't hear my friend right next to me.  She got a beer that had a rusty bottle & the waitress told her they were out of a beer as we were served that very beer on the next round.",1
"The Dockside should be synonomous with Shadey.  It's basically a dive bar with your typical greasy platters of burgers, wings, and other bar staples severed along side cheap beers and copious sports filled TV screens.  There's usually a few older Alchy's hanging out drinking their breakfast lunch and dinner's while oggling the young moderately attractive female waitstaff.  If you want to really have a shadey experience, go down stairs to the ""dance floor.""  It's jam packed, sweaty and pitch black.  God knows what goes on down t here...  Two stars for shady factor-  it can be kinda fun.",2
"Not worth the trip - they have $.99 Pabst, but other than that, no reason to go. It is noisy, the dancing is cheesy, and the people are obnoxious.",2
"The official place to watch the University of Texas college football. All UT alumni gathers at this bar to watch the game every Saturday during the fall, so if you see everyone in their burnt orange shirts and caps this is the reason. Other than that, it's cramped and dark. It has your typical pub food that is relatively inexpensive yet at the same time nothing worth eating. 

The service and staff were slow and not very accommodating. All the tables and chairs seemed a little sticky. Overall I would rather not come back to this place but probably will since they do play the UT game.

Restrooms: Out of the three stalls I was lucky enough to find one stall clean enough to go. The other two were clogged with toilet paper and other unmentionable things that you don't want to know about.",2
"I had a lot of respect for this place... the atmosphere was awesome and I love the food and the bar. It's a bit pricey but heck it's in the city. What stopped me from going was when my husband and I were out for a nice romantic evening one night and we asked to sit somewhere quiet. Well, they sat us next to a table where there was a women breast feeding nearly the entire time we were there. It was so inappropriate. On top of that the couple was having dinner with some loud pompous ass who wanted everyone in the restaurant to hear him talk... drawing attention to their table as if the breast feeding woman sitting there with him wasn't enough. We were trying to grin and bare it until 2 more couples come in with their freakin infants. That was our breaking point. We were stuck in the front room with 3 infants, one who was breast feeding. God help us! It was not what we had expected from a hip place in the Highlands. What a bummer! We'll never go back b/c of that incident.",2
"Meh. I've experienced better is a good description. You need to go have some of this gelato and then go over the 15th Ave and have some Mio gelato. Parisi's has a stabilizer in it that makes it very gummy like you can stretch it with your spoon up 6 in and it stays connected. This is not how gelato should be. We were not impressed and actually sorry we brought guests to try it for the first time.

I can't comment on the other items they sell we only had gelato but a month in Italy tells me this is not good gelato. Go to Mio on NE 15th & Brazee or Staccato on NE 28th & Everett both are soooo much better. They have the right consistency - Staccato is a little smoother but Mio has more flavors I like.",2
"This is a sucky chain, and I generally like chains.  The service was typical for a place like this (poor), but the food was really sub-par.  I only got appetizers too.  Do you know how hard it is to mess up buffalo wings?  Apparently not that hard for Bennigans.  The were soggy and cold and the potato skins tasted like Styrofoam.  I gave it two stars because my beer was cold and my girlfriend seemed to enjoy the place...",2
"Um... what is this?  This is the epitome of gross chain food that tries to appeal to tourists by being a touristy spot, but really - there is no reason to go here.  The food is gross, the beers are actually pretty expensive and the atmosphere is a step down from an Applebees.",2
The food is eh?  Service is hit or miss.   Everything tastes bland and blah.,2
"We had the worst experience here ... tons of empty tables and they sat us next to a big loud party (we could have touched them).  The waitress was unfriendly.  Tim was served half chicken fingers, half fish ""fingers"" (not what he wanted), and no one cleared away ANY of our dishes.  

There are other, better places to check out in the Theatre District.",1
Shit. Could you imagine the liquidation sale this place would have? The walls were like the Brimfield antiques show!,1
"I'm as big an anti-chain snob as anyone, and Bennigans is predictably awful...

BUT....there's a secret about Bennigans...

they have the best chicken fingers in the entire world. And the best honey mustard dipping sauce too. 

I don't know why, but I swear it's true. If you find yourself at a Bennigans, order nothing else. But, oh, those chicken fingers...they remind me of half-days in high school when we'd get out of school early and go to the Bennigans on Rt 46 in Fairfield; everyone would order the same thing: golden chicken strips, with double fries, and extra honey mustard. It's a wonder we all weren't obese.",2
"Just got back from dinner with a friend. We were seated in the corner and the light above our table was missing its light bulb. We promptly asked to be moved to another table. 
Ordered the fried mushrooms and they were excellent, not a ton of batter on them which is good.
For the main entree I ordered the Guinness Sirloin Steak. Asked for it medium and when it came to the table I swear it still had a pulse. I'm not opposed to rare steak but I definitely wanted it cooked medium.
Ordered a Half and half (Harp lager with Guinness poured on top) too much harp not enough Guinness.",2
"""I didn't know they had a Ruby Tuesday's in this part of town. ""

I was on my way to Viga, and then this former office slut I used to work with, said she would buy lunch if we go to an actual restaurant.... SOLD!

I should have have faked a leg cramp in front of McCormick & Schmick's ... :( 

I am not sure how this stop was determined, but what a WASTE.

I HATE restaurants that cover their walls in random flare... I always get paranoid that a poorly mounted tricycle is going to fall on my head, or a STOP SIGN is going to crash onto the table... Why can't they just paint the walls? What the hell is up with the sign that said ""Bicycles""? I didn't see any fucking bicycles... am I at Back Bay Bicycles? No, I'm hanging out at T.G.I. Friday's, 9 months after the condom broke with his girlfriend Applebee's... 

Same fucking menu with every DEEP FRIED chicken salad PRE-LOADED with fatty honey mustard. Hamburgers on rolls that taste like a stick of butter. And a full menu of heart stopping desserts. and 'Sup with the prices?! Am I in Times Square?! 

The restaurant was empty when we got there at 1:00, but we were seated next to the only office party. I am not sure why... our tables were so close, that I thought we were going to be on the same tab. I should have asked if we could sit under the dangling pool table / canoe combo in the back of the restaurant.

The service wasn't that slow, but then again it was DEAD. I think my waitress was 15, so I'm not sure if that was legal, and they had the WORST radio station on.

Wait, this is a chain? I hope not... 

I need to go eat some laxatives, and put a stick of celery in a lunch bag for tomorrow...",2
"Ok, I was trying to get a quick bite to eat before heading into see Step Brothers (which sucked) this past Saturday night at the AMC Loews Boston Common 19. Anyhow, I took a high top at the bar and scanned the menu. I immediatey went to the bar which had a rather sketchy group of patrons sitting about and tried to get the bartenders attention. I literally stood there for 5 minutes without her bothering to look up. The bar wasn't even busy! I can totally understand why Bennigan's filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy today! Anyhow, we left and caught a few slices of mushroom pizza around the corner. Screw you Bennigan's!",1
"I was really excited to eat at Bennigans as I've heard so many good things about this restaurant, but I was very disappointed... First, the  menu is rather limited and the selection isn't the greatest.  After looking the entire menu, I decided on a Blu Cheese Pita Buger with bacon.  After I ordered, the waitress informed me there was no more bacon left....now, normally it would be okay but I was in the mood for bacon and that was the primary reason why i ordered the damn pita burger.   So, I hestitated for a second and just said okay that's fine.. After she left, I was thinking...WTF how can a restaurant not have bacon?  How hard is it to go down the street and buy some bacon?? When half of the items on their menu include bacon, how can the restaurant not carry any?? UGH, i LOVE BACON SO GIMME MY BACON DAMMIT!! Anyway, i ate the burger and quickly left.",2
"So, apparently, two stars is the official review of ""Meh™"", as indicated by the blurb above.  ""Meh"" is how I feel, but these people seriously don't deserve three stars, which I would've originally pegged as ""meh"", so I'm pretty happy about how that seems to be working out.

I mean... what can I say that other people haven't said?  I wanted not to look at other people's reviews, but they're right over there on the right bar, and I see the words ""not the least flavorful"", ""pretty much sucks now"", ""kinda mushy"", ""just OK"", etc.  And that covers one of the issues -- its impressive mediocrity.  But not the one I'm about to pretentiously address.

What it doesn't cover is that this place epitomizes a problem with Atlanta.  Call it style over substance, or a trendy craving for ""authenticity"" (notice the quotes -- I was trying to make those into air quotes, which more accurately capture the contempt I'm going for), or a sick, mindless love of brands or name-dropping.  This place only survives because our backwards restaurant ecosystem supports it.  We (also note that I'm accusing I'm-a-manager-at-Proctor-and-Gamble-who-lives-in-Alpharetta-and-talks-a-lot-about-his-football-team Atlantans, not the Yelp crowd, who have properly recognized this place as what it is) seem to love having been to places that indicate our knowledge, or hipness, or culture, or other such dreck, without regard to whether we actually liked them -- that almost isn't a concern in Atlanta.  This place is mediocre in every possible way.  It isn't real Southern food, and it's not a good modification of Southern food, but it pretends that it exudes some sort of Southern charm, or that it's ""classic"" in some way.  I'm not a fan in the slightest of the kitschy angle, but they don't even do a good job of that.  The ingredients are just kinda there.  The menu isn't interesting.  It's not put together well.  It's not horrible, but maybe it would be better that way?  At least it would be SOMETHING?  At least it would be memorable in some way?  This whole place is an attempt to take the wisps of an atmosphere and turn it into an experience -- Atlantans love 'experience' food.  But that atmosphere is just lame and false.

It's just kind of offensive that this place even walks (sits on?) the face of this earth.  It's an insult to food.  It's certainly an insult to anyone who goes there -- it's kind of like, ""haha, you idiot -- you fell for our theme, and now we're going to laugh at it AND you while we serve you food that even we think is instantly forgettable"".  It's not bad.  It's totally edible.  But for some reason, that makes it worse.  I hate this place and everything it represents in life.",2
"After stating her grilled cheese sandwich was not hot, our 4 year old guest got it right.when she said ""this is a cafeteria"".  Our mashed potatoes were cold, the green bean casserole was grey and we were underwhelmed by everything else. So sad, this place use to be so awesome...",1
"Well I registered on Yelp just to add a review for A&M... Having been there several times over the past 10 years however not having been there in over 2 years I was shocked by the sorry state of things. Upon entering tonight signs were hung everywhere advertising the Best Ribs in Atlanta. Even tho I noticed most of the ""fun"" decor was gone and that the dessert freezers were completely empty we sat down only to discover there were no ribs available nor several other items. We had the fried chicken which tasted like it was flash thawed in the microwave... The new owners need help I am sorry to say....",1
"So, Agnes & Muriel's moved, with the following results:

-everything I liked (decor, coziness, crowd, location) is gone
-everything I didn't like (NOTABLY bad service, mediocre food) is still there.

Met at 11 on Saturday for girls' brunch.  The place was more or less empty.  The furniture was thick mahogany standardized furniture and not cute.  The tablecloths, chandeliers, and other cutesy things were nowhere to be seen.  Sad.  

We ordered from a youngish server who did not seem to give too much of a care.  It's Passover and I'm pescatarian, so I ordered the mushroom feta omelet, described as: ""filled with sauteed mushrooms, peppers, feta cheese, and tomatoes"" with potatoes.  I told the server - ""please just make sure there's no bread on the plate whatsoever.""  My dining companions made fun of me for this comment as if it weren't necessary.  My friend ordered a different omelet with grits and bacon.

So when the food comes, he tries to give me my friend's omelet with grits first, then we tell him it's wrong and he gives me the one that was supposed to be mine - I get no potatoes, but a biscuit on my plate!  The ONE thing I specifically asked for?  And the guy seemed completely unapologetic.  I mean, it wasn't a big deal, but I specifically asked, and mine wasn't even supposed to come with a biscuit. 

OK, and then the omelet?  I don't think there was a single mushroom in it, and the cheese was goat cheese, not feta.  It was basically red pepper, tomato, and goat cheese with possibly a couple of mushrooms.  It was fine (not great) but I mean, not what I ordered.

No wonder the place was empty.  What a disappointment.",2
"well, the Barbie Doll flare is still here but the food has been smashed into the carpet like a cigarette butt.  Stinky and harmful to the soul. 

Use to be a B+ now it's no better than a D. So, sad..... Save your dough.",2
"I think I may have solved the mystery as to why the quality of Agnes & Muriel's has been on a steady decline - they've changed ownership!! 

Last time I visited, I was dismayed to find that the yummy turkey meatloaf was gone.  Well, this time, the fried okra AND pot roast are also discontinued.  I had to settle for the beef meatloaf, but it was not the least flavorful - kinda mushy blah.  

How sad that an ownership change has left a great Atlanta establishment like Agnes & Muriel's with only its kitschy style, but not the delicious food that it once served up.",2
"My memories and recent dining experience of Agnes & Muriel's were pretty consistent:  fun atmosphere but mediocre food that sits heavy.  I was a bit disappointed by the food...again.  How much can you mess up home cooking?  

Obviously, a bit.

Avoid the crab cakes.  They were overly seasoned and didn't taste fresh.  I sampled the pot roast and it wasn't bad at all.  Mac and cheese is a little plastic tasting and the green bean casserole is better if you make it at home with Campbell's soup and frozen beans.  Fried green tomatoes also without much flavor.

The artichoke dip was by far the highlight of the meal...one of the best I've had.  Too bad the main courses can't hold up to the standard of the appetizers.  If you want a real home cooked meal, go down the street to Mary Mac's Tea Room, or if you are on the cheap, enjoy better sides and meat at Eat's.",2
"I grew up in Atlanta and this was one of our favorite family restaurants.  As an adult I have tried taking my husband there a few times and he has always been disappointed.  My opinion was always colored by memories of dinners past, until this week.  Our waitress said the restaurant was on the verge of moving to Buckhead, so maybe that explains why they were out of their signature dishes - Fried Chicken,  Thanksgiving Sandwich, and Banana Pudding.  My tea was watered down.  There was no one in the restaurant on a Thursday night.  I will say that the Fried Pickles were delicious.  Hopefully when they get to their new location it will be back up to par.",1
"Looking through my magic looking glass, I see a cute little restaurant that use do be a home. You can tell that it once had a great concept, 50's retro meets barbie dolls and tea cup chandeliers, but it looks like this house is on it's last leg - literally. I think it is about to slide down the hill it is perched on. Let's face it - Run Down! 

Food - well, if you like to eat fattn'n southern comfort food like Cheese and Mac, banana pudd'n with Nilla wafers, and deep fried Airline Chicken - I found your salivary hangout. Just overlook the deterioration folks. Cute for a brunch or tourist that is staying at your house. 

Great for dinner when you don't feel like bothering or really need fat.",2
"Well, being a girly girl, I must say that this is a cute place!  I love how it's nestled in a neighborhood on a busy street.  If you blink, you might miss the house, but the cute sign out front will catch your eye.  Blink again and you'll certainly miss the ""driveway"" that takes a serious dip into parts unknown.  Fortunately, a valet will approach you right before you get that sinking reminder that your brakes should have been cleaned and adjusted the week before.  Shivers!

A co-worker likes the place and wanted me to give it a whirl, so we went.  The decor is pastel and cozy; every bit of what a girly girl craves.  The desserts are displayed right up front as merciless teasers.  Other food... um, well....  Did I say that the decor was cute?  Really, the food is okay.  I got veggies and left most of them on my plate.  They were overcooked.  The sweet tea was good, though.  The service was decent.

It does seem like a table got crammed in every square inch, however, and the place is quite loud; you are in CONSTANT competition with your ""neighbors"".  Here's a tip:  once you get in your seat, STAY in your seat; don't even think about getting up until it's time to go.  To do otherwise is to risk ramming a chair in someone's face as you try to scoot (yes, SCOOT) away from the table; and after you've done all that hopskotching through the maze of crowded tables, you'll then have to become eel-like to get back in your chair .  Trust me on this, you'll be better off staying put!",2
"Sadly, the old Agnes and Muriel's is no more. We went to Sunday Brunch, and much to our dismay, discovered that everything we loved about the old A&M is gone. We waited 5 minutes at the door before anyone noticed us, and then waited 45 minutes for our food. The server, Mark, seemed agitated to be there, and was VERY unfriendly.  We noticed several other tables who walked out without being served food (and they still had to pay the valet).  The ""kitchy"" flare has been replaced with drab walls, the service was awful, and the food was terrible.  The fried okra was different (seemed to be out of a bag), the mac&cheese was watery and bland, and I never got my collard greens (or an apology, OR a replacement).  And to make matters worse, instead of discounting my ""4-vegetable plate"" from $10 to $7.50, Mark decided to just charge me $2.75 for 3 individual veggies.  $.75 not that big a deal, but just terrible restaurant practices.  

The valet had one guy working, and our car was in the front and did not need to be ""pulled around"" so we asked for the keys.  We left him no tip because he never actually DID anything except take our keys, and he says ""There is a $1 service fee"".  Mind you, there are not one, but TWO signs that state ""COMPLIMENTARY VALET""!  We were so fed up we just gave him two bucks and got out.

Don't waste your time with A&M anymore.  It is gone, so go to Mary Mac's or some other true ""Mom and Pop"" eatery because this one is dead.",1
"awful place! rude staff.  ugly interior, not what the website shows at all.  no dinner menu only small plates.  havent been to a place worse then this!  This place was maybe nice when it first open but not anymore. bad bad bad",1
"I went here once before with a friend and it was so amazing and wonderful, but it seems like they have taken a severe downward spiral. When we asked to see a wine list, our waiter, who seemed to be so high on cocaine he could hardly speak straight, stated that they only had four bottles, and then brought all four to us on the table (?!). We chose one, raised some eyebrows, and it came to us about 3/4 full with the cork already off. He asked if we wanted him to open it or if we should. Again, WTF?
Our salads were nice, but that was so weird...
The wine we had tasted like it had been open for over a week. And what restaurant in their right mind who has proper inventory control runs out of wine on Friday night of President's Day Weekend? Come ON! It's ridiculous.
Our neighboring diners were vegetarians, and they ordered the ""Porcini burger"".. which comes with Wild Boar. Their waiter told them that they should have known due to the initials ""WB"" on the list of ingredients in the burger. Yeah, that's what I think of... hmm.
I'm sorely disappointed. This place was so amazing and was something I was looking forward to after such an amazing experience in September. Now it just sucks.",1
"I came in here on Saturday night for some live music. My friend and I arrived around 8:00 figuring we could grab a bite to eat before the music started. What was interesting is the patio area looked kinda cool with the fountain and lots of outdoor seating but the only place we could enter inside the building was downstairs. 

Walking into the space I thought it looked pretty freakin' cool with the travertine tiles on the large bar and the shiny tiles on the walls surrounding the dance area. I also noticed two rooms that appeared to be sectioned off from the other area with sheer panels. Inside were dozens and dozens of cool pillows. My thought was ""this would be a cool place to have a private party"".

The bartender was really friendly and asked if we wanted to order something. Approaching the bar, I realized how huge it was. I mean it would have been kinda difficult for our sort of smallish bartender to actually hand me a drink across it as we were both in the 5' 2"" height area. We asked about food and were given paper menus that had maybe 7 items on them and told that they were re-vamping the menu and that this was all that they offered right now. We decided to go somewhere else to eat dinner and come back for the band.

When we arrived back here at 9:00 one of the private rooms were filled with a group of young women who seemed to be having a lot of fun. I could see someone in the DJ booth but honestly I don't even think they were playing any music yet. They still wouldn't let us in upstairs where the band was playing so we ordered a couple of drinks and sat down. Now I really had a chance to look the place over.

I loved the concept they were going for and I appreciated the travertine and all the other more upscale appointments but when looking at everything through new eyes I realized that a lot of the stuff was kinda dirty. There were water marks on the tables, candle wax dripping off one section of the bar, dust on the shelves, and in the women's bathroom there was soap splashed up on the wall that looked as if it had been there for quite some time.

When we finally got to go upstairs (via the patio - kinda strange), it was hard to get a good feel for the place because they had obviously pushed the pool tables out of the way for the band and the huge bar took up so much of the rest of the space. Again, beautiful appointments but everything looked a little dirty and not well cared for.

Parking wasn't too bad because it was early but I can see how it could be a bitch if the place is popping.",2
"Yaay: spinach and artichoke dip.

BOO: our group getting cut off by our waiter after the 3rd round.
""This is a family restaurant, guys""

Chilis - it's ok if you're in the BURBS OF OHIO but in the center of boston?  Use yelp to find a better place that you can't find in like 2,000 locations nationwide.",2
"Now I hadn't been to Chili's since I was a wee child and my father used to take me to the Chili's in Harvard Square. I used to love it, I remember the Fajitas plate was so much fun, a 9 yr old kid loves crap that comes in a metal skillet and has so many choices of how you can put it together! So I found a gift certificate on the sidewalk, and what would you know, it had $22 on it, so I said to myself, might as well check it out and have a few free beers. Well, first thing, where the hell is there a chili's? they used to be everywhere. Not anymore! That should show you something right off the bat. I have lived in Boston my whole life and only last week found out that there was a Chili's in the Copley mall. Well, it was small, cramped, the TV's were tiny and like a mile away (I missed good Monday night football!) The beer was nice and cold and fresh, but common guys, chains? None of this chain stuff. I'm not saying you need to get creative every time you go out and eat a meal, but if I'm not mistaken Chili's is owned by Dunkin Donuts. The food is alright, but not interesting at all, and not worth the price. Go to your local joint and support small business, it's always better!",2
"every once in awhile i get nostalgic for college, when we used to sit in the smoking section at chili's and drink strawberry margaritas. my boyfriend convinced me to come here one night for dinner and UGH. maybe chili's loses out on something by being in a mall as opposed to being in a strip mall off of route one in the dirty jerz, but this chili's sucked. the tables felt sticky and disgusting and the whole place smelled like the bathrooms and it almost made me not want to eat. the only bright spot was my black bean burger with mustard and pickles, which is continually delicious, probably because they are made in some plant and sent to every chili's in the country to be heated up when a customer orders it. oh and the fries, which are seasoned with crack or something because i just can't stop eating them. no ambiance of course (although i didn't expect it), surly service, and you could possibly face a ridiculous wait since you're fighting all the tourists for a table.

i left my umbrella here by accident and my boyfriend was like ""just LET IT GO!! let's get OUT OF HERE!!""

next up on the college nostalgia tour: the olive garden?",2
"I came here for the Baby Back Bonus Special since the ads were non-stop on TV about this $9.99 deal which includes a salad, 1/2 rack of baby back ribs, and a desert to boot. I didn't want to be disappointed; but I was. I had the Caesar salad, and it was alright - nothing too special about romaine leaves with shaved parm. The ribs (being the star of the show) were quite a let down however, being unforgivingly chewy, stringy and tough. Perhaps they left it on the grill too long and forgot about it, since it had the consistency of leather basted in bourbon barbecue sauce. My desert (mudslide pie) was really, really sweet in a sickening way and I gave up about 3 forkfuls later. But my biggest gripe was probably my server Joe who obviously didn't want to work there and displayed the corresponding unprofessional attitude quite apparently.",2
"I've been to this place several times now because I live and work in the area. I really don't like the idea of giving a place a bad review based on one or two experiences, because you never know who may be having a bad day, but holy crap this place is AWFUL.

I've come here for takeout twice now. The first time, I got a salad with lettuce so gross and wilted that had I been in the restaurant, I would have sent it back (not something I ever do). Tonight, I arrived just as my order was coming out, paid, walked maybe seven minutes back home to get ice-cold, soggy fries and a lukewarm burger. SO disgusting!

I've come with a group from work after booking a reservation and ended up waiting for at least 15-20 minutes (of our hour lunch break). The service was then so slow and horrible that I said I'd never go back, but at least that time the food was warm. I seem to forget how all around BAD this place is approximately every six months, so here I am now writing it down to ensure that I NEVER go again.",1
"Outback is a standard chain restaurant, nothing amazing about it.... but after a 3-day (60 mile) walk for breast cancer... and a ""meat and potatoes family"" - we all wanted something that went moooooooooooo served up nice and bloody on our plate.

Sister said her steak salad was just 'eh
Mom and dad didin't complain or rave about their dishes
My filet with blue cheese on top was nice
My walking partner's dish was a disaster - ordered medium rare... came out well done. Sent it back, they took her side dish with it. Manager comes over with attempt #2 - again... well done... come to find out the kitchen read our server's note wrong. Attempt #3, finally done correctly, but by that point she'd had so many half eaten sides (b/c they brought her a new one each time) that she wasn't hungry for her steak!

Bonus to the disaster was that they were super nice about it, we weren't a bitchy table, and they gave us free deserts while she ate her steak... but she ordered dessert too, and charged us for it.... whatever.

I've had some really good Outback adventures, but all were in VA - this one in Quincy, not my favorite. Oh yea... and did I mention the restaurant was DEAD.. and it still took a decent amount of time to get our food to us... dude... what was goin on? Your saving grace, Outback, was that we had lots to talk about and kept ourselves entertained.",2
"I haven't had any horrible stories, but I don't like this place.  Granted, I don't eat meat, so I am limited to just a few sides or deep friend appetizers, but even when I did eat animals, I still didn't care for the menu.

Service has always been adequate, and food was never too bad.  I simply never suggest this place, and its a last resort type deal.",2
"I recentlly moved to this neighborhood and have been there twice. The first time they brought me the wrong drink order (which atleast they let us keep for free), and didn't have the ingredients for the drink my friend ordered (new bartender, so they said). The 2nd time though, not so good. The bread, which I normally love, was overcooked and crispy. both my scallops and my mom's steak were over-seasoned with pepper.",2
"Eh..it's an Outback.  I hate how they sit next to you when taking the order.  Lame!  Other than that I like their sweet potato and that's about it.  Oh, the house salad is okay too.  But, I find the outback to be overpriced.",2
"This particular location, not so good for some reason! The last 2 times we have been disappointed. For the quality you get, way too pricey",2
"As of 7/30/10, this Outback location is closed.

(I drove by last night in hopes to have dinner here, and was surprised to find the location boarded up.)",1
"I typically like the Outback. However, this location seemed less than ideal. I went here twice. The food was blah. I had the steaks, their main dish and was disappointed.

Chains :(

Quincy Ctr, so red line, bus, or private parking lot (free).",2
"Takes forever to get drinks and they are constantly screwing with their menu. also, it seems depending on the night, you either can or can not get boneless kukabara wings. We never had a problem before but the day we went this last time, the waiter insisted it wasn't available cause it wasn't on the menu. Even though we told him reoeatedly, ""We get it all the time,"" he wasn't hearing it. So, finally we told him what to do which is what managers have told us in the past. ""It's technically not on the menu but if you want them boneless, what we do is use the kids chicken fingers and dip them in the kukabara sauce.""  EUREKA!  We have split the atom!

Anyway, the burgers are usually great but other than that, everything is just loaded with salt and fat and the quality is sub-par. But, as others have said, it's the Outback--a chain so what can you expect?",2
"Recently, I felt really sick after eating their Bloomin' Onion Burger...

It hasn't happened to me before while eating here at least.",2
"...well the vegetables here are good!
Haha. Last night was my second time going to this place and both times my steak just shy of satisfactory.",2
"You call this a Martini?!

Water on the top, Poland Springs Vodka for the last 3 sips.

Seriously?",2
"if you like dirty atmosphere, with glasses filled with dirt specks, and when you get your food it seems cold, salty, dry and shitty. then you might like this place.  this place is a shithole, no wonder it closed.  i dont understand it.  everytime i go there, the meal is shitty, and the place is pretty grungy looking.  disgusting.",1
"The owner is a complete ass! I accidentally walked out on a $6 aka ($6) tab went the next day to pay and apologize. The ""manager"" aka owner told me I'm banned and my money isn't welcome. After a laugh I thought he was kidding. He then proceeded to say he was a new business owner and I took advantage of him and I'm banned.... At first I laughed thinking he was kidding, he wasn't! My bill was $6 I left and wanted to leave that and a tip for the bartender it was an honest mistake! He said my money is no good and too leave. I left a $20 bill and left never will be back. The owner is a dick and with that attitude a business won't last long!",1
"Located of route 1a in the Modell's mall, I was curious about this one.  I had heard about this burger place that also has a huge ice cream selection.  However, you heard more positive notes about the ice cream then the burgers!  

I walked in and the ice cream selection is huge, 80 plus flavors.  They sell Richardson's ice cream.  Pretty good stuff.  The burger experience was not as good.  The burgers were cooked too high and a medium became well done.  The meat looks and tastes like it was from a BJ's multi-pack.  The tomatoes are pink and they are pretty skimpy on the cheese.  I tried the sweet potato fries and they were half soggy.  That and the a little too high prices made the experience memorable not to come visit again.",2
"The only thing worth coming for is the ice cream. They have Richardsons's (the best!) in a ton of flavors, and they even packed it to-go for us in their ice cream sundae tubs as a favor (since they don't normally do that, we really appreciated it!). However, their meals are waaay overpriced (12$ for steak tips in a strip-mall joint? I don't think so!) Plus, the taste and cooking isn't enough to justify such a high price in the first place.",2
"Do I eat at mall food courts? YES. Am I ashamed to eat at mall food courts? Until now, no, I was not. This restaurant gets a star for service and a star for price. Do I expect to be blown away? Not really, but I was more confused than anything by this restaurant. It seemed like all the other places in the food court came together in a meeting and said, "" we need a way to liquidate all of our mismatched food that is on its way to being expired, so let's create a restaurant that can serve a mixup of anything we don't want."" I have had ""cajun"" food once or twice before, and this was like KFC and City Wok had a baby. Walking down the selection of combo platter options was even more unusual...and I ended up with a platter containing a generous serving of white rice, some bland carrots, some crusty elbow mac'n'chesse, and general gaus chicken. I am definitely paying for it today. The portions were large, and the people that work there are really nice, but I would not recommend this place unless you want to send your tastebuds to a land where things do not complement one another. Next time, if I want this feeling, I will just make an ice cream hamburger, or a lobster milkshake...",2
"2 stars about sums up this place. Essentially it is General Gau's by a different name. I really don't know what this place has to do with Cajun food, but I imagine orange chicken is not a traditional dish. They do have fried sweet plantains but I found these a little bland. Service was friendly as well.",2
"I was here twice recently. The first time was slightly better than the first, if that's a compliment. The food is displayed out nice, but looks aren't everything. The second time I got the same order, three sides with rice. I wasn't paying attention too closely since I had an important phone call while ordering. Maybe the girl behind the counter noticed that and decided to screw me over. Got home with my food, not too far away, and opened the Styrofoam container. Half of the container was Jambalaya rice, let me rephrase that, yellow rice with tiny bits of peas and carrots, ice cold. Now on to the next three items! Bourbon chicken, 4 small pieces, burnt and stringy. Boneless ribs, all fat, chewy and greasy. Doesn't matter how many I got, all inedible. Broccoli, 4 cold soggy pieces as well. I ate a couple of spoonfuls of rice, the bourbon chicken, and the rest, the garbage disposal thoroughly enjoyed. One star is too many for this garbage dump, I'd like to give them one finger instead, and I don't mean chicken.",1
"They lure you in with their cheap prices, but their selection of food is one of the most random things I've ever seen. Orange chicken, frozen corn, and some sour tasting mac and cheese was what I got for around 7 dollars. I wanted some decent food, but the only thing I got was heartburn.",1
What can u say? Run of the mill greasy food court food. Great after a night of drinking to soak up the booze.,2
"Typing this from the toilet. That should let you know the quality of this place.

Much of the previous reviews nailed it.. 

Lured in with free sample, was walking away when basically ushered into line. I thought, ""What the hell, haven't tried it. Couldn't be bad."" Boy was I wrong. 

Strange, peculiar food combinations. Undercooked orange chicken pieces, with brown and white rice, frozen corn, frozen spinach?  

I have no idea who thought this cuisine up. 30 minutes later, I was feeling stomach grumbles and pains, followed by an extensive visit to the men's room.

Save your money, time, and digestive system.  Go somewhere else.",1
"the prawn appetizer about 4 years ago was hella killer.  But that those days of garlic bread dipp'n in that tomato and oil, on the patio with a Stella. are done",1
"They ran out of wings and told us after we waited about an hour for them. Since that time, I have gone back to give them another try. However, the service is never really good. I think they are trying to create an atmosphere equivalent to Cactus Club/Earls, meaning pretty girls acting posh but super nice and approachable, but they are just not there. Maybe if the food was good. My friend ordered a pasta which tasted bland and my husbands wings were drenched with so much sauce that he felt like he was drinking it. Aren't the wings supposed to be made with the sauce as opposed to dumping sauce on top? I have been here 3 times and have had a poor experience every time.",1
